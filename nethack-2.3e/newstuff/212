   I got this one fixed last night. It was caused by passing three arguments
to the kludge() routine, which is only defined with two arguments. This
routine probably should have been a macro instead of a subroutine, but I
just took the call to kludge() out of mhitu.c, and replaced it with a
call to pline() containing a '(Blind) ? "It" : Monnam(...)'.
