Summary: Here's how to get it to compile under Turbo C...

I got it to compile under Turbo C 1.5.  These are the changes I needed
to make it compile:

topten.c : I wrote a little link() procedure for the LOGFILE code.
Basically the pseudo-link() only looks to see if the lock file exists,
and if not, creates it.

makedefs.c : Either use a -DMSDOS, or (like I did for portability),
add an #ifdef __MSDOS__, #define MSDOS, #endif.

mkshop.c : Add a void mkzoo(), mkswamp() in mkshop() after the #ifdef
WIZARD.

rip.c : Add ", 3" parameter to the strncmp(.., "Mr."/"Ms.") calls.

Then it compiled, but put little H's all over the screen.  I found the
bug in tgoto.c in the termcap code.  Just add a *out = 0 before it
returns.

Two other little mites:

msdos.c : the read_config_file() still reads 17 GRAPHICS values, just
expand it in the obvious places if you want to customize the sink
symbol.

pray.c : THEOLOGY knows about cursed armor, but doesn't know about
Hawaiian shirts.  You can add uarmu to the end of the uarm... if's,
enclosed in #IFDEF SHIRT of course.

One big mite:

All these changes made, it runs real pretty, but it goes catatonic
when i go downstairs from the first level.  I'm looking for this one.
I'll post the diffs for these problems when I get it working.
