Patch #1
========

There is a serious bug in NetHack which allows players to get almost
infinite scores (billions of points) with ease. Credit for finding
this goes to one of our local NetHack devotees -- Stuart McCormack.

It seems that when demons try to blackmail you, a negative amount of
gold can be specified as a peace offering. The demon gets mad and
the player gets rich. To do this properly, one must then teleport to
level 0 -- billions of gold pieces will cause even the strongest
player to collapse.

This fix (to mhitu.c) will make this tatic obsolete.


Patch #2
========

The second fix in this posting (to zap.c) addresses a "feature"
which many people here found annoying. Dragons which breathe death
rays can appear around level 8 upwards, and are inevitably deadly at
that stage. In the interests of game playability this fix implements
a saving throw versus experience level and luck when the player
is hit by a death ray (any death ray due the the method of implementing
breath weapons).


Request
=======

It is extremely annoying to die whilw reading a spell book.
Would it not be better to allow the player to react and have
the transcribe fail? Has anyone implemented this?
