X#     Special section for DEC Rainbow owners.
X#
X#  You *must* include the option `DECRainbow' in the OPTIONS line
X#  if you want to use line-drawing charcters.  Also, you must *not*
X#  use the option `rawio' or your system will hang!
X#
X#  You can select the "Rainbow line-drawing character set"
X#  for drawing the dungeon.  For *graphics* characters,
X#  128 has been added to the decimal value of the character.
X#  Adding 128 lets PC HACK know you want it to use the line-drawing
X#  character set.  Non-graphical characters are indicated by
X#  their decimal value.  You can mix both types of characters in
X#  the GRAPHICS line.
X#
X#  A recommended configuration for the Rainbow using the
X#  line-drawing character set, two floppies and no ramdisk is:
