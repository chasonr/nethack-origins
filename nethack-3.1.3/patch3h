X%Cc A 00001
XYou are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
Xappear to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It looks
Xas if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
Xbeen under siege.
X
XAll of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
Xthe entrance.
X
XStrange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
X%E
X%Cp A 00002
XOnce again, you are back at %H.
X%E
X%Cp A 00003
XYou are back at %H.
XYou have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
X%E
X%Cp A 00005
X"Man, the dig this year was a real bust!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00006
X"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
X%E
X%Cp A 00007
X"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
X%E
X%Cp A 00008
X"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
X%E
X%Cp A 00009
X"So you're %l's prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
X%E
X%Cc A 00010
X"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
Xmy most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
Xmost difficult task of your career."
X%E
X%Cp A 00011
X"Again, %p, you stand before me.
XLet me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
X%E
X%Cp A 00012
X"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
XAre you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
X%E
X%Cc A 00013
X"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
Xvain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!
X
X"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
X%E
X%Cc A 00014
X"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
Xquest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
Xsurvive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
Xtaught you."
X%E
X%Cc A 00015
X"%p!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
Xresults lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!
X
X"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
Xback only when you have purified yourself."
X%E
X%Cc A 00016
X"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
Xstolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
Xthe university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.
X
X"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
Xyou will find the %n.
X
X"You must the defeat the %n and return %o
Xto me.
X
X"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
Xclose this college.
X
X"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
X%E
X%Cp A 00020
X"Beware, for the %n is powerful and cunning."
X%E
X%Cp A 00021
X"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
Xmany traps."
X%E
X%Cp A 00022
X"%nA may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
X%E
X%Cp A 00023
X"Call upon %d when you encounter the %n."
X%E
X%Cp A 00024
X"You must destroy the %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
X%E
X%Cp A 00025
X"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
Xcan destroy the %n."
X%E
X%Cp A 00026
X"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
X%E
X%Cp A 00027
X"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
X%E
X%Cp A 00028
X"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
X%E
X%Cp A 00029
X"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
X%E
X%Cp A 00030
XYou have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
X%i.
X%E
X%Cp A 00031
XOnce again, you are near the entrance to %i.
X%E
X%Cp A 00040
XYou sense the presence of %o.
X%E
X%Cp A 00041
XThe familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
X%E
X%Cc A 00050
X"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
X%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.
X
X"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
X%E
X%Cc A 00051
X"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.
X
X"You shall never recover %o.
X
X"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
X%E
X%Cp A 00052
X"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00053
X"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
Xupon your entrails!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00060
X"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
X%E
X%Cp A 00061
X"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00062
X"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
X%E
X%Cp A 00063
X"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
Xfalter!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00064
X"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00065
X"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
X%E
X%Cp A 00066
X"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00067
X"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
X%E
X%Cp A 00068
X"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
X%E
X%Cp A 00069
X"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
X%E
X%Cc A 00070
XThe power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
Xas if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
Xyou know you must return %o to %l.
X%E
X%Cp A 00080
XThe body of the %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
X%E
X%Cc A 00081
X%l touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
Xthen smiles at you and says:
X
X"Well done, %p.  You have defeated the %n and
Xrecovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
Xhere.
X
XPlease take %o with you.  You, %p, can
Xguard it now far better than I.
X
XMay the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
X%E
X%Cc A 00090
X"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
Xregain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
X%E
X%Cc A 00091
X"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
Xthe Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
Xfinal adventure.
X
X"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the astral plane.
XThere you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
XAmulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.
X
X"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."

XWarily you scan your surroundings, all of your senses alert for signs
Xof possible danger.  Off in the distance, you can see the familiar shapes
Xof %H.
X
XBut why, you think, should %l be there?
X
XSuddenly, the hairs on your neck stand on end as you detect the aura of
Xevil magic in the air.
X
XWithout thought, you ready your weapon, and mutter under your breath:
X
X    "By %d, there will be blood spilt today."
X%E
X%Cp B 00002
XOnce again, you near %H.  You know that %l
Xwill be waiting.
X%E
X%Cp B 00003
XAgain, and you think possibly for the last time, you approach
X%H.
X%E
X%Cp B 00005
X"The battles here have been good -- our enemies' blood soaks the soil!"
X%E
X%Cp B 00006
X"Remember that glory is crushing your enemies beneath your feet!"
X%E
X%Cp B 00007
X"There has been little treasure to loot, since the horde arrived."
X%E
X%Cp B 00008
X"The horde is mighty in numbers, but they have little courage."
X%E
X%Cp B 00009
X"%l is a strange one, but he has helped defend us."
X%E
X%Cc B 00010
X"Ah, %p.  You have returned at last.  The world is in dire
Xneed of your help.  There is a great quest you must undertake.
X
X"But first, I must see if you are ready to take on such a challenge."
X%E
X%Cp B 00011
X"%p, you are back.  Are you ready now for the challenge?"
X%E
X%Cp B 00012
X"Again, you stand before me, %p.  Surely you have prepared yourself."
X%E
X%Cc B 00013
X"Pah!  You have betrayed the gods, %p.  You will never attain
Xthe glory which you aspire to.  Your failure to follow the true path has
Xclosed this future to you.
X
X"I will protect these people as best I can, but soon %n will overcome
Xme and destroy all who once called you %s.  Now begone!"
X%E
X%Cc B 00014
X"%p, I fear that you are as yet too inexperienced to face
X%n.  Only %Ra with the help of %d could ever hope to
Xdefeat him."
X%E
X%Cp B 00015
X"%p!  You have wandered from the path of the %a!
XIf you attempt to overcome %n in this state, he will surely
Xenslave your soul.  Your only hope, and ours, lies in your purification.
XGo forth, and return when you feel ready."
X%E
X%Cc B 00016
X"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.
X
X"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
Xas %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
Xabout him.
X
X"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
Xpotent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.
X
X"%n and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
Xthe people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
X%o, and seeks to bend it to his will.  I detected the
Xsubtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
XThen I sent forth a summons for you.
X
X"If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become
Xalmost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
Xmen across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
Xand with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.
X
X"You must go to %i.  From there, you can track down
X%n, defeat him, and return %o to us.  Only
Xthen will the world be safe."
X%E
X%Cp B 00020
X"%n is strong in the dark arts, but not immune to cold steel."
X%E
X%Cp B 00021
X"Remember that %n is a great sorcerer.  He lived in the time
Xof Atlantis."
X%E
X%Cp B 00022
X"If you fail, %p, I will not be able to protect these people long."
X%E
X%Cp B 00023
X"To enter %i, you must be very stealthy.  The horde will be on
Xguard."
X%E
X%Cp B 00024
X"Call upon %d in your time of need."
X%E
X%Cp B 00025
X"May %d protect you, and guide your steps."
X%E
X%Cp B 00026
X"If you can lay hands upon %o, carry it for good fortune."
X%E
X%Cp B 00027
X"I cannot stand against %n's sorcery.  But %d will help you."
X%E
X%Cp B 00028
X"Do not fear %n.  I know you can defeat him."
X%E
X%Cp B 00029
X"You have a great road to travel, %p, but only after you defeat
X%n."
X%E
X%Cc B 00030
XThe scent of water comes to you in the desert breeze.  You know that
Xyou have located %i.
X%E
X%Cp B 00031
XYet again you have a chance to infiltrate %i.
X%E
X%Cc B 00040
XThe hairs on the nape of your neck lift as you sense an energy in the
Xvery air around you.  You fight down a primordial panic that seeks to
Xmake you turn and run.  This is surely the lair of %n.
X%E
X%Cp B 00041
XYet again you feel the air around you heavy with malevolent magical energy.
X%E
X%Cc B 00050
X"So.  This is what that second rate sorcerer %l sends to do his bidding.
XI have slain many before you.  You shall give me little sport.
X
X"Prepare to die, %c."
X%E
X%Cp B 00051
X"I have wasted too much time on you already.  Now, you shall die."
X%E
X%Cp B 00052
X"You return yet again, %c!  Are you prepared for death now?"
X%E
X%Cp B 00053
X"I shall have %o back, you pitiful excuse for %ca.
XAnd your life as well."
X%E
X%Cp B 00060
X"My pets will dine on your carcass tonight!"
X%E
X%Cp B 00061
X"You are a sorry excuse for %ra."
X%E
X%Cp B 00062
X"Run while you can, %c.  My next spell will be your last."
X%E
X%Cp B 00063
X"I shall use your very skin to bind my next grimoire."
X%E
X%Cp B 00064
X"%d cannot protect you now.  Here, you die."
X%E
X%Cp B 00065
X"Your %a nature makes you weak.  You cannot defeat me."
X%E
X%Cp B 00066
X"Come, %c.  I shall kill you, then unleash the horde on your tribe."
X%E
X%Cp B 00067
X"Once you are dead, my horde shall finish off %l, and your tribe."
X%E
X%Cp B 00068
X"Fight, %c, or are you afraid of the mighty %n?"
X%E
X%Cp B 00069
X"You have failed, %c.  Now, my victory is complete."
X%E
X%Cc B 00070
XAs you pick up %o, you feel the power of it
Xflowing through your hands.  It seems to be in two or more places
Xat once, even though you are holding it.
X%E
X%Cp B 00080
X%n falls to the ground, and utters a last curse at you.  Then his
Xbody fades slowly, seemingly dispersing into the air around you.  You
Xslowly become aware that the overpowering aura of magic in the air has
Xbegun to fade.
X%E
X%Cc B 00081
XWhen %l sees %o, he smiles, and says:
X
X    Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
X    What, now, should be done with %o?
X
X    These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
X    other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did.
X
X    Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in
X    your adventures, and you can best guard it.  You embark on a
X    quest far greater than you realize.
X
X    Remember me, %p, and return when you have triumphed.  I
X    will tell you then of what you must do.  You will understand when the
X    time comes.
X%E
X%Cp B 00090
X"Tell us, %p, have you fared well on your great quest?"
X%E
X%Cc B 00091
X"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
Xsucceed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
Xof Yendor!
X
X"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
Xthe Book of Skelos, I found this:
X
X    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
X    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
X    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
X    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.
X
X"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
Xspeaks of you.
X
X    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
X    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
X    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
X    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.
X
X"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."

Xouter caves are absent, and an uneasy quiet fills the damp air.

Xquest."

X%Cc C 00016
X"You are indeed ready now, %p.  I shall tell you a tale of
Xgreat suffering among your people:
X
X"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by
Xthe creatures sent against us by the %n.
X
X"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
Xhave harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the
Xminions of the %n managed to steal %o.
XThey took it to %i and there, none of our
X%g warriors have been able to go.
X
X"You must find %i, and within it wrest
X%o from the %n.  She guards it as
Xjealously as she guards all treasures she attains.  But with it,
Xwe can make our caves safe once more.
X
X"Please, %p, recover %o for us, and return it here."
X%E
X%Cp C 00020

X%E

X"Your best chance with the %n will be to keep moving."
X%E

X"Do not be distracted by the great treasures in the %n's lair.

X%E
X%Cc E 00016
X"You are indeed ready, %p.  I shall tell you what has transpired,
Xand why we so desperately need your help:
X
X"A short time ago, the Uruk-hai tribes of the mountains to the east
Xinvaded and enslaved the Goblin tribes in this area.  The local
X%n is now only a figurehead, and serves the Uruk-hai Overlord.
X
X"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
Xorcs and goblins, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
Xheaded by the %n himself, managed to breach the circle and
Xsteal %o.
X
X"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
Xwe will be able to maintain our magical barriers.
X
X"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
X%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
Xunderground castle of the %n.  He has always coveted
X%o, and will surely keep it on his person,
Xuntil he delivers it to the Uruk-hai Overlord.
X
X"Recover %o for us, %p!  Only then will
Xthe circle of %d be safe."
X%E
X%Cp E 00020

X%E
X%Cp E 00022
X"Use %o, when you find it.  It will help you survive
Xto reach us."
X%E
X%Cp E 00023
X"Remember, let %d be your guide."
X%E
X%Cp E 00024
X"Call upon %d when you face the %n.
XThe very act of doing so will infuriate him, and give you advantage."
X%E
X%Cp E 00025
X"Though the %n is as %C as we, he and his kind have always
Xhated us."
X%E
X%Cp E 00026
X"We cannot hold the circle much longer, %p.  Hurry!"
X%E
X%Cp E 00027
X"To infiltrate %i, you must be very stealthy."
X%E
X%Cp E 00028
X"Remember that the %n is a braggart.  Trust not what he says."
X%E
X%Cp E 00029
X"You can triumph, %p, if you trust in %d."
X%E
X%Cc E 00030
XYou descend into the outer regions of %i.  You can hear
Xscuffling sounds in the corridors, and vague mumblings in the distance.
X
XYou remember that %ga once told you that there were many secret
Xpassageways in this complex.
X%E
X%Cp E 00031
XOnce again, you descend into %i.
X%E
X%Cc E 00040
XYou descend into a weird place, in which roughly cut cave-like walls
Xjoin with smooth, finished ones, as if someone was in the midst of
Xfinishing off the construction of a subterranean complex.
X
XOff in the distance, you hear the sounds of a large, raucous gathering.
X%E
X%Cp E 00041
XOnce again, you enter the distorted castle of the %n.
X%E
X%Cc E 00050
X"So, %c.  %l has sent you to recover %o.
X
X"Well, I shall keep that bauble.  It pleases me.  You, %c, shall die."
X%E

X%E
X%Cp E 00069
X"You weaken, %c.  I shall kill you now."
X%E
X%Cc E 00070
XAs you pick up %o, it seems to glow, and a warmth
Xfills you completely.  You realize that its power is what has protected
Xyour %sp against their enemies for so long.
X
XYou must now return it to %l without delay -- their lives depend
Xon your speed.
X%E
X%Cc E 00080
XThe %n collapses to the ground, cursing you and %l, then says:

X%E
X%Cc E 00081
X"%p!  You have succeeded!  I feared it was not possible!
X
X"Your aura proclaims that you possess %o!
X
X"I fear, now, that the Uruk-hai will select yet another %n.
XThis will take some time, but if you can recover the Amulet of Yendor
Xfor %d before that happens, we will be eternally safe.
X
X"Take %o with you.  It will aid in your quest for

X%E
X%Cc E 00091
X"Utuelyes!  You have recovered the Amulet of Yendor!
XNow attend to me, %p, and I will tell you what must be done:
X
X"The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to
Xthe Astral Plane, where the primary circle of %d resides.
X
X"To activate this magic, you must travel upwards as far as you can.
XWhen you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to %d.

X

XNotes on Building NH3.1.3 with Think C
X
XIn General
X
X	What is different between MPW and Think C?
X
X	Think C does not have a shell, :-(.  MPW does.  Ugh.  The lack of
Xshell requires the cumbersome task of result file management.  Our approach
Xhas been to move all result files into the topmost directory.  This is done
Xso that NetHack can be compiled and run from the topmost directory.  (In
Xthe future, we want to modify the compilers to place to result files into a
Xresult directory, and NetHack to look for its files in the result directory).
X
X	Life without a shell also requires the NetHack resource file to 
Xbe put together by hand.  This is one area that Think C 6.0 has improved our
Xlives.  Under 6.0, we can now add E.rsrc and E.r files as source to the
Xproject.  Dot rsrc files will be added to the project rsrc file directly and
Xdot r files will be compiled and then added.  For those who are without Think
X6.0, good luck.  The best approach is to use the resource compiler to compile
Xthe dot r file, and name the result as the projects rsrc file.
X
X	Makedefs is another story.  When run, a command window pops up.  Just
Xtype in the options you require.  When the files are generated, some of the
Xresult files will have to be moved to the top level directory (data files) or
Xto the include area (header files).
X
X	Needless to say, all of the above stuff that we must do because of
Xthe lack of shell also implies no Makefile, so we must be aware of what
Xfiles that we have modified and which files are dependent upon these modified
Xfiles.  In other words, we must constantly ask ourselves "gee, do we need to
Xrun Makedefs again?".  Life is tuff; this is to help you get used to it.
X
X	What follows are most of the steps that we take in compiling NH3.1.3.
XIf some are left out, blame it on late night TV and a small PB screen.  If
Xyou find something left out, or think a little more detail is needed, send us
Xsome mail.
X
X	This is the second release of these notes.  We are sure stuff has
Xbeen left out.  So if you hit a snag, feel free to contact us.  We want and
Xneed to debug this port.
X
X	We can be reached at nethack-bugs@linc.cis.upenn.edu
X
XThe Steps
X
X	-2.	Read the Think C manuals.  Know your compiler and your
Xenvironment.  They are your friends and you are stuck with them.
X	
X	-1.	Get Think Reference or buy a bunch of books that cover
XMacintosh programming (the correct number of books can be determined when you
Xstart seeing the same stuff over and over again -- or you run out of cash).
X		
X	0.	Learn C and the standard io library.
X	
X	From here, we will assume that you know how to build and compile
Xprojects, how file names are resolved, what a project's resource file is
Xfor, and how the resource compiler works.  If you don't, repeat the above
Xsteps.
X	
X	1.	Grab the sources, maintaining the directory structure.  We will
Xrefer to the top most directory as 'top'.
X
X	2.	Move the project files to top.  The projects are MakeDefs.proj,
XDgnComp.proj, LevComp.proj and NetHack.proj.
X	
X	3. Modify the source
X
X	sys:mac:hack.h
X		a. this should be deleted.  It is needed for the MPW build
X		   and will interfere with the Think C compile.
X		   
X	include:hack.h
X		a. this file should be renamed 'include:realhack.h'.
X		b. create a new file 'sys:mac:NetHack Headers.c'
X		 with a single line :
X			#include "realhack.h"
X		c. precompile this new file and save the precompile output
X		   as 'include:hack.h'
X
X	sys:share:lev_lex.c sys:share:lev_yacc.c sys:share:lev_main.c
X		a. change inclusion of 'hack.h' to 'realhack.h'
X
X	4. Move and/or rename files
X
X		a. move top:sys:mac:MacHelp to top:MacHelp
X		b. move top:sys:mac:News to top:News
X		c. move and rename top:sys:mac:NHDeflts to
X		 top:sys:mac:NetHack Defaults
X
X	5. Build and run MakeDefs
X
X		a. -v to build 'options'.
X		b. -o to create 'onames.h'.
X		c. -p to create 'pm.h'.
X		d. -z to create 'vis_tab.c'.
X		e. -e to create 'dundeon.pdf'.
X		f. -m to create 'monstr.c'.
X		g. -d to create 'data'.
X		Move 'top:dat:data' to 'top:data'.
X		h. -r to create 'rumors'.
X		Move 'top:dat:rumors' to 'top:rumors'.
X		i. -h to create 'oracles'.
X		Move 'top:dat:oracles' to 'top:oracles'.
X		j. -q to create 'quest.dat'.
X		Move 'top:dat:quest.dat' to 'top:quest.dat'.
X
X		
X	6. Compile and run LevComp.
X
X	7. Compile and run DgnComp.
X		Move 'top:dat:dungeon' to 'top:dungeon'.
X
X	8. Compile and run NetHack.
X
XAppendix
X
XA. Futures
X
X	1.	Modify NetHack to look for data files in the folder 'data'.
X	2.	Take advantage of the new scripting abilities of Think C 6.0.
X
XB. Project Contents
X
XAll projects should have both far code and far data set.  Set the
Xapplication size of NetHack.proj to a couple of megs.
X
XSet the application size of LevComp.proj to a meg (We suspect that there is a
Xmemory leak in there somewhere).  All projects should contain the libraries
XMacTraps, ANSI, and unix.
