Xtell you of what has transpired:
X
X"At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, %n and a legion
Xof undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
Xthe one carrying %o.
X
X"As a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
XWithout it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
Xbarely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.
X
X"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
Xto %n's lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
X%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
Xundead that befoul the land.
X
X"Go with %d as your guide, %p."
X%E
X%Cp P 00020
X"You can prevail, if you rely on %d."
X%E
X%Cp P 00021
X"Remember that %n has great magic at his command."
X%E
X%Cp P 00022
X"Be pure, my %S."
X%E
X%Cp P 00023
X"Beware, %i is surrounded by a great graveyard."
X%E
X%Cp P 00024
X"You may be able to affect %n with magical cold."
X%E
X%Cp P 00025
X"Acquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
Xagainst %n."
X%E
X%Cp P 00026
X"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
X%E
X%Cp P 00027
X"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
X%E
X%Cp P 00028
X"Do not loose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger."
X%E
X%Cp P 00029
X"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
X%E
X%Cc P 00030
XYou stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
Xthat seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
Xundead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.
X
XYou remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
Xthe %l.  It is ahead that you will find %n's trail.
X%E
X%Cp P 00031
XAgain, you stand before %i.
X%E
X%Cc P 00040
XThe stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
Xof tortured souls assault your psyche.
X
XAhead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
X%E
X%Cp P 00041
XAgain, you have invaded %n's domain.
X%E
X%Cc P 00050
X"Ah, so the %l has sent another %g to retrieve
X%o.
X
X"No, I see you are no %g.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
Xafter all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
X%o."
X%E
X%Cp P 00051
X"So, %r.  Again you challenge me."
X%E
X%Cp P 00052
X"Die now, %r.  %d has no power here to aid you."
X%E
X%Cp P 00053
X"You shall die, %r, and I will have %o back."
X%E
X%Cp P 00060
X"Submit to my will, %c, and I shall spare you."
X%E
X%Cp P 00061
X"Your puny powers are no match for me, %c."
X%E
X%Cp P 00062
X"I shall have you turned into a zombie for my pleasure!"
X%E
X%Cp P 00063
X"Despair now, %r.  %d cannot help you."
X%E
X%Cp P 00064
X"I shall feast upon your soul for many days, %c."
X%E
X%Cp P 00065
X"Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"
X%E
X%Cp P 00066
X"You cannot defeat %n, you fool.  I shall kill you now."
X%E
X%Cp P 00067
X"Your precious %l will be my next victim."
X%E
X%Cp P 00068
X"I feel your powers failing you, %r.  You shall die now."
X%E
X%Cp P 00069
X"With %o, nothing can stand in my way."
X%E
X%Cc P 00070
XAs you pick up %o, you feel the essence of
X%d fill your soul.  You know now why %n stole it from
X%H, for with it, %ca of %d could
Xeasily defeat his plans.
X
XYou sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
Xget the impression that you must return to the %l as soon
Xas possible.
X%E
X%Cc P 00080
XYou feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %n's body dissolves
Xinto a cloud of noxious gas.
X
XSuddenly, a voice booms out:
X
X    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.
X    Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
X    As for you, %n, I shall deal with thy failure
X    at my leisure.
X
XYou then hear the voice of %n, screaming in terror...
X%E
X%Cc P 00081
X"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
XCongratulations.
X
X"I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
Xa minion of %d.  %d commands that you retain
X%o.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
Xof Yendor.
X
X"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
X%E
X%Cp P 00090
X"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"
X%E
X%Cc P 00091
X"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,
Xyou must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on %d's altar on
Xthe Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this
Xlife, but I hope to at %d's feet."

XUnexpectedly, you find yourself back in Ransmannsby, where you trained to
Xbe a thief.  Quickly you make the guild sign, hoping that you AND word
Xof your arrival reach the %l's den.
X%E
X%Cp R 00002
XOnce again, you find yourself back in Ransmannsby.  Fond memories are
Xreplaced by fear, knowing that the %l is waiting for you.
X%E
X%Cp R 00003
XYou rub your hands through your hair, hoping that the little ones on
Xthe back of your neck stay down, and prepare yourself for your meeting
Xwith the %l.
X%E

X"I hear that Lady Tyvefelle's household is lightly guarded."
X%E
X%Cp R 00006
X"You're back?  Even the Twain don't come back anymore."
X%E
X%Cp R 00007
X"Can you spare an old cutpurse a zorkmid for some grog?"
X%E
X%Cp R 00008
X"Fritz tried to join the other side, and now he's hell-hound chow."
X%E
X%Cp R 00009
X"Be careful what you steal, I hear the boss has perfected turning
Xrocks into worthless pieces of glass."
X%E
X%Cc R 00010
X"Well, look who it is boys -- %p has come home.  You seem to have
Xfallen behind in your dues.  I should kill you as an example to these
Xother worthless cutpurses, but I have a better plan.  If you are ready
Xmaybe you could work off your back dues by performing a little job for
Xme.  Let us just see if you are ready..."
X%E
X%Cp R 00011
X"Well, I didn't expect to see you back.  It shows that you are either stupid,
Xor you are finally ready to accept my offer.  Let us hope for your sake it
Xisn't stupidity that brings you back."
X%E
X%Cp R 00012
X"Did you perhaps mistake me for some other %l?  You must
Xthink me as stupid as your behavior.  I warn you not to try my patience."
X%E
X%Cc R 00013
X"Well %gp, it looks like our friend has forgotten who is the boss
Xaround here.  Our friend seems to think that %rp have been put in
Xcharge.  Wrong.  DEAD WRONG!"
X
XYour sudden shift in surroundings prevents you from hearing the end
Xof the %l's curse.
X%E
X%Cc R 00014
X"In the time that you've been gone you've only been able to master the
Xarts of %ra?  I've trained ten times again as many %Rp
Xin that time.  Maybe I should send one of them, no?  Where would that
Xleave you, %p?  Oh yeah, I remember, I was going to kill you!"
X%E
X%Cc R 00015
X"Maybe I should chain you to my perch here for a while.  Perhaps watching
Xreal %A men at work will bring some sense back to you.  I don't
Xthink I could stand the sight of you for that long though.  Come back
Xwhen you can be trusted to act properly."
X%E
X%Cc R 00016
X"Will everyone not going to retrieve %o from that
Xjerk, the %n, take one step backwards.  Good choice,
X%p, because I was going to send you anyway.  My other %gp
Xare too valuable to me.
X
X"Here's the deal.  I want %o, the %n
Xhas %o.  You are going to get %o
Xand bring it back to me.  So simple an assignment even you can understand
Xit."
X%E
X%Cc R 00020
X"You don't seem to understand, %o isn't here so
Xneither should you be!"
X%E
X%Cp R 00021
X"May %d curse you with lead fingers.  Get going!"
X%E
X%Cp R 00022
X"We don't have all year.  GET GOING!"
X%E
X%Cc R 00023
X"How would you like a scar necklace?  I'm just the jeweler to do it!"
X%E
X%Cp R 00024
X"Lazy S.O.B.  Maybe I should call up someone else..."
X%E
X%Cp R 00025
X"Maybe I should open your skull and see if my instructions are inside?"
X%E
X%Cp R 00026
X"This is not a task you can complete in the afterlife, you know."
X%E
X%Cc R 00027
X"Inside every living person is a dead person trying to get out, and I have
Xyour key!"
X%E
X%Cp R 00028
X"We're almost out of hell-hound chow, so why don't you just get moving!"
X%E
X%Cp R 00029
X"You know, %o isn't going to come when you
Xwhistle.  You must get it yourself."
X%E
X%Cp R 00030
XThose damn little hairs tell you that you are nearer to
X%o.
X%E
X%Cp R 00031
XNot wanting to face the %l without having stolen
X%o, you continue.
X%E
X%Cc R 00040
XYou feel a great swelling up of courage, sensing the presence of
X%o.  Or is it fear?
X%E
X%Cp R 00041
XThe hairs on the back of your neck whisper -- it's fear.
X%E
X%Cc R 00050
X"Ah!  You must be the %l's ... er, `hero'.  A pleasure
Xto meet you."
X%E
X%Cc R 00051
X"We meet again.  Please reconsider your actions."
X%E
X%Cp R 00052
X"Surely, %p, you have learned that you cannot trust any bargains
Xthat the %l has made.  I can show you how to continue on
Xyour quest without having to run into him again."
X%E
X%Cp R 00053
X"Please, think for a moment about what you are doing.  Do you truly
Xbelieve that %d would want the %l to have
X%o?"
X%E
X%Cp R 00060
X"May I suggest a compromise.  Are you interested in gold or gems?"
X%E
X%Cp R 00061
X"Please don't force me to kill you."
X%E
X%Cp R 00062
X"Grim times are upon us all.  Will you not see reason?"
X%E
X%Cp R 00063
X"I knew the %l, and you're no %l, thankfully."
X%E
X%Cp R 00064
X"It is a shame that we are not meeting under more pleasant circumstances."
X%E
X%Cp R 00065
X"I was once like you are now, %p.  Believe in me -- our way
Xis better."
X%E
X%Cp R 00066
X"Stay with me, and I will make you %o's guardian."
X%E
X%Cp R 00067
X"When you return, with or without %o,
Xthe %l will have you killed."
X%E
X%Cp R 00068
X"Do not be fooled; I am prepared to kill to defend %o."
X%E
X%Cp R 00069
X"I can reunite you with the Twain.  Oh, the stories you can swap."
X%E
X%Cc R 00070
X"As you pick up %o, the hairs on the back of your
Xneck fall out.  At once you realize why the %n was
Xwilling to die to keep it out of the %l's hands.  Somehow
Xyou know that you must do likewise."
X%E
X%Cc R 00080
X"I know what you are thinking, %p.  It is not too late for you
Xto use %o wisely.  For the sake of your guild
X%sp, do what is right."
X
XYou sit and wait for death to come for the %n, and then you
Xbrace yourself for your next meeting with the %l!
X%E
X%Cc R 00081
X"Well, I'll be damned.  You got it.  I am proud of you, a fine %r
Xyou've turned out to be.
X
X"While you were gone I got to thinking, you and %o
Xtogether could bring me more treasure than either of you apart, so why don't
Xyou take it with you.  All I ask is a cut of whatever loot you come by.
XThat is a better deal than I offered the %n.
X
X"But, you see what happened to the %n when he refused.
XDon't make me find another to send after you this time."
X%E
X%Cc R 00090
X"Quite the little thief, aren't we, %p.  Can I interest you in a
Xswap for %o.  Look around, anything in the keep
Xis yours for the asking."
X%E
X%Cc R 00091
X"I see that with your abilities, and my brains, we could rule this world.
X
X"All that we would need to be all-powerful is for you to take that little
Xtrinket you've got there up to the Astral plane.  From there, %d will
Xshow you what to do with it.  Once that's done, we will be invincible!"

XEven before your senses adjust, you recognize the kami of
X%H.
X
XBut why is the standard of your teki, %n, flying
Xabove the town?  Why are ronin wandering freely, where are the
Xsamurai of your daimyo, %l?
X
XYou quickly say a prayer to Izanagi and Izanami and walk towards
Xtown.
X%E

XOnce again, you are back at %H.
X%E

XYou are back at %H.

X"Once again, %p-san, you kneel before me.  Are you yet capable of
Xbeing my vassal?"
X%E

XIf you cannot determine what I want in a samurai, how can I rely on you
Xto figure out what I need from a samurai?"

X"%p-san, you would do better to join the kyokaku.

X"Domo %p-san, indeed you are ready.  I can now tell you what
Xit is that I require of you.

X%o and taken it to his donjon deep within
X%i.

Xfor the festival he will know that I have failed in my duty, and
Xrequest that I commit seppuku.

XYou are humbled knowing that you hold one of the artifacts of the

X%E
X%Cc S 00080
XYour healing skills tell you that %n's wounds are mortal.
X
XYou know that the bushido tells you to finish him and let his kami
Xdie with honor, but the thought of so many samurai dead due to this
Xman's dishonor prevents you from giving the final blow.
X
XYou order that his unwashed head be given to the crows and his body
Xthrown into the sea.
X%E
X%Cc S 00081
XAs you bow before %l, he welcomes you:
X
X    You have brought your family great honor, %p-sama.
X
X    While you have been gone the emperor's advisors have discovered in
X    the ancient texts that the karma of the samurai who seeks to recover
X    the amulet and the karma of %o are joined
X    as the seasons join to make a year.
X
X    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
X    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the
X    road that fate has set your feet upon.  I would consider it
X    an honor if you would allow me to watch your household until
X    you return with the amulet.
X
XWith that, %l bows, and places his sword atop
X%o.
X%E

X%l bows.  "%p-sama, tell us of your search for the Amulet."

X%Cc S 00091
X"Ah, %p-sama.  You have wasted your efforts returning home.
XNow that you are in possession of the Amulet, you are honor-bound to
Xfinish the quest you have undertaken.  There will be plenty of time
Xfor saki and stories when you have finished.

X
XYou quickly notice that things do not appear the way they did when you
Xleft.  The town is dark and quiet.  There are no sounds coming from

X    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
X    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
X    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
X    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
X    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
X    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.
X
XYour god %d seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
Xto gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.
X
XYou, a newly trained %r, have been heralded
Xfrom birth as the instrument of %d.  You are destined
Xto recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the
Xattempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake
Xof us all:  Go bravely with %d!
X%E
X%Cp - 00002
XYou receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
XYour help is urgently needed at %H!
XLook for a ...ic transporter.
XYou couldn't quite make out that last message.
X%E

XYou again sense %l pleading for help.
