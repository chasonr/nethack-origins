X\section{Introduction}
X
X%.pg
XYou have just finished your years as a student at the local adventurer's
Xguild.  After much practice and sweat you have finally completed your
Xtraining and are ready to embark upon a perilous adventure.  To prove
Xyour worthiness, the local guildmasters have sent you into the Mazes of
XMenace.  Your quest is to return with the Amulet of Yendor.  According
Xto legend, the gods will grant immortality to the one who recovers this
Xartifact; true or not, its recovery will bring honor and full guild
Xmembership (not to mention the attentions of certain wealthy wizards).
X
X%.pg
XYour abilities and strengths for dealing with the hazards of adventure
Xwill vary with your background and training.
X
X%.pg
X%
X\blist{}
X\item[\bb{Archeologists}]%
Xunderstand dungeons pretty well; this enables them
Xto move quickly and sneak up on dungeon nasties.  They start equipped
Xwith proper tools for a scientific expedition.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Barbarians}]%
Xare warriors out of the hinterland, hardened to battle.
XThey begin their quests with naught but uncommon strength, a trusty hauberk,
Xand a great two-handed sword.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Cavemen {\rm and} Cavewomen}]
Xstart with exceptional strength and neolithic weapons.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Elves}]%
Xare agile, quick, and sensitive; very little of what goes
Xon will escape an Elf.  The quality of Elven craftsmanship often gives
Xthem an advantage in arms and armor.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Healers}]%
Xare wise in medicine and the apothecary.  They know the
Xherbs and simples that can restore vitality, ease pain, anesthetize,
Xand neutralize
Xpoisons; and with their instruments, they can divine a being's state
Xof health or sickness.  Their medical practice earns them quite reasonable
Xamounts of money, which they enter the dungeon with.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Knights}]%
Xare distinguished from the common skirmisher by their
Xdevotion to the ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing excellence of
Xtheir armor.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Priests {\rm and} Priestesses}]%
Xare clerics militant, crusaders
Xadvancing the cause of righteousness with arms, armor, and arts
Xthaumaturgic.  Their ability to commune with deities via prayer
Xoccasionally extricates them from peril---but can also put them in it.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Rogues}]%
Xare agile and stealthy thieves, who carry daggers, lock
Xpicks, and poisons to put on darts.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Samurai}]%
Xare the elite warriors of feudal Nippon.  They are lightly
Xarmored and quick, and wear the %
X{\it dai-sho}, two swords of the deadliest
Xkeenness.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Tourists}]%
Xstart out with lots of gold (suitable for shopping with),
Xa credit card, lots of food, some maps, and an expensive camera.  Most
Xmonsters don't like being photographed.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Valkyries}]%
Xare hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in the harsh
XNorthlands makes them strong and inures them to extremes of cold, and instills
Xin them stealth and cunning.
X%.pg
X%
X\item[\bb{Wizards}]%
Xstart out with a fair selection of magical goodies and
Xa particular affinity for dweomercraft.
X\elist
X
X%.pg
X\nd You set out for the dungeon and after several days of uneventful
Xtravel, you see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes
Xof Menace.  It is late at night, so you make camp at the entrance and
Xspend the night sleeping under the open skies.  In the morning, you
Xgather your gear, eat what may be your last meal outside, and enter
Xthe dungeon.
X
X%.hn 1
X\section{What is going on here?}
X
X%.pg
XYou have just begun a game of {\it NetHack}.  Your goal is to grab as much
Xtreasure as you can, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and escape the
XMazes of Menace alive.  On the screen is kept a map of where you have
Xbeen and what you have seen on the current dungeon level; as you
Xexplore more of the level, it appears on the screen in front of you.
X
X%.pg
XWhen {\it NetHack\/}'s ancestor {\it rogue\/} first appeared, its screen
Xorientation was almost unique among computer fantasy games.  Since
Xthen, screen orientation has become the norm rather than the
Xexception; {\it NetHack\/} continues this fine tradition.  Unlike text
Xadventure games that input commands in pseudo-English sentences and
Xexplain the results in words, {\it NetHack\/} commands are all one or two
Xkeystrokes and the results are displayed graphically on the screen.  A
Xminimum screen size of 24 lines by 80 columns is recommended; if the
Xscreen is larger, only a $21\times80$ section will be used for the map.
X
X%.pg
X{\it NetHack\/} generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even the
Xauthors still find it an entertaining and exciting game despite
Xhaving won several times.
X
X%.hn 1
X\section{What do all those things on the screen mean?}
X%.pg
XIn order to understand what is going on in {\it NetHack}, first you must
Xunderstand what {\it NetHack\/} is doing with the screen.  The {\it NetHack\/}
Xscreen replaces the ``You see \ldots'' descriptions of text adventure games.
XFigure 1 is a sample of what a {\it NetHack\/} screen might look like.

X\subsection*{The status lines (bottom)}
X
X%.pg
XThe bottom two lines of the screen contain several cryptic pieces of
Xinformation describing your current status.  If either status line
Xbecomes longer than the width of the screen, you might not see all of
Xit.  Here are explanations of what the various status items mean
X(though your configuration may not have all the status items listed
Xbelow):
X
X%.lp
X\blist{}
X\item[\bb{Rank}]
XYour character's name and professional ranking (based on the
Xexperience level, see below).
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Strength}]
XA measure of your character's strength, one of your six basic
Xattributes.  Your attributes can range from 3 to 18 inclusive
X(occasionally you may get super-strengths of the form 18/xx).  The
Xhigher your strength, the stronger you are.  Strength affects how
Xsuccessfully you perform physical tasks and how much damage you do in
Xcombat.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Dexterity}]
XDexterity affects your chances to hit in combat, to avoid traps, and
Xdo other tasks requiring agility or manipulation of objects.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Constitution}]
XConstitution affects your ability to withstand injuries and other
Xstrains on your stamina.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Intelligence}]
XIntelligence affects your ability to cast spells.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Wisdom}]
XWisdom comes from your religious affairs.  It affects your magical energy.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Charisma}]
XCharisma affects how certain creatures react toward you.  In
Xparticular, it can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Alignment}]
X%
X{\it Lawful}, {\it Neutral\/} or {\it Chaotic}.  Basically, Lawful is
Xgood and Chaotic is evil.  Your alignment influences how other
Xmonsters react toward you.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Dungeon Level}]
XHow deep you have gone into the dungeon.  It starts at one and
Xincreases as you go deeper into the dungeon.  The Amulet of Yendor is
Xreputed to be somewhere beneath the twentieth level.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Gold}]
XThe number of gold pieces you have.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Hit Points}]
XYour current and maximum hit points.  Hit points indicate how much
Xdamage you can take before you die.  The more you get hit in a fight,
Xthe lower they get.  You can regain hit points by resting.  The number
Xin parentheses is the maximum number your hit points can reach.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Power}]
XSpell points.  This tells you how much mystic energy ({\it mana\/})
Xyou have available for spell casting.  When you type `{\tt +}' to
Xlist your spells, each will have a spell point cost beside
Xit in parentheses.  You will not see this if your dungeon
Xhas been set up without spells.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Armor Class}]
XA measure of how effectively your armor stops blows from unfriendly
Xcreatures.  The lower this number is, the more effective the armor; it
Xis quite possible to have negative armor class.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Experience}]
XYour current experience level and experience points.  As you
Xadventure, you gain experience points.  At certain experience point
Xtotals, you gain an experience level.  The more experienced you are,
Xthe better you fight and withstand magical attacks.  Many dungeons
Xshow only your experience level here.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Time}]
XThe number of turns elapsed so far, displayed if you have the
X%.op
X{\it time\/} option set.
X%.lp
X\item[\bb{Hunger Status}]
XYour current hunger status, ranging from %
X{\it Satiated\/} down to {\it Fainting}.  If your hunger status is normal,
Xit is not displayed.
X%.pg
XAdditional status flags may appear after the hunger status:
X{\it Conf\/} when you're confused, {\it Sick\/} when sick, {\it Blind\/}
Xwhen you can't see, {\it Stun\/} when stunned, and {\it Hallu\/} when
Xhallucinating.
X\elist
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{The message line (top)}
X
X%.pg
XThe top line of the screen is reserved for messages that describe
Xthings that are impossible to represent visually.  If you see a
X``{\tt --More--}'' on the top line, this means that {\it NetHack\/} has
Xanother message to display on the screen, but it wants to make certain
Xthat you've read the one that is there first.  To read the next message,
Xjust press the space bar.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{The map (rest of the screen)}
X
X%.pg
XThe rest of the screen is the map of the level as you have explored it
Xso far.  Each symbol on the screen represents something.  You can set
Xthe
X%.op
X{\it graphics\/}
Xoption to change some of the symbols the game uses; otherwise, the
Xgame will use default symbols.  Here is a list of what the default
Xsymbols mean:
X
X\blist{}
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{- and |}]
XThe walls of a room, or an open door.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{.}]
XThe floor of a room, or a doorless doorway.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{\#}]
XA corridor, or possibly a kitchen sink or drawbridge (if your dungeon
Xhas sinks or drawbridges).
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{<}]
XA way to the previous level.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{>}]
XA way to the next level.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{+}]

Xdungeon has spell books).
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{@}]
XA human (you, usually).
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{\$}]
XA pile of gold.

X%.lp
X\item[\tb{a-zA-Z \& other symbols}]
XLetters and certain other symbols represent the various inhabitants
Xof the Mazes of Menace.  Watch out, they can be nasty and vicious.
XSometimes, however, they can be helpful.
X
X%.pg
XYou need not memorize all these symbols; you can ask the game what any
Xsymbol represents with the `{\tt /}' command (see the Commands section for
Xmore info).
X\elist
X
X%.hn 1
X\section{Commands}
X
X%.pg
XCommands are given to {\it NetHack\/} by typing one or two characters;
X{\it NetHack\/} then asks questions to find out what it needs to know to do
Xyour bidding.
X
X%.pg
XFor example, a common question in the form ``{\tt What do you want to
Xuse? [a-zA-Z\ ?*]}'', asks you to choose an object you are carrying.
XHere, ``{\tt a-zA-Z}'' are the inventory letters of your possible choices.
XTyping `{\tt ?}' gives you an inventory list of these items, so you can see
Xwhat each letter refers to.  In this example, there is also a `{\tt *}'
Xindicating that you may choose an object not on the list, if you
Xwanted to use something unexpected.  Typing a `{\tt *}' lists your entire
Xinventory, so you can see the inventory letters of every object you're
Xcarrying.  Finally, if you change your mind and decide you don't want
Xto do this command after all, you can press the `ESC' key to abort the
Xcommand.
X
X%.pg
XYou can put a number before most commands to repeat them that many
Xtimes; for example, ``{\tt 10s}'' will search ten times.  If you have the
X%.op
X{\it number\_pad\/}
Xoption set, you must type `{\tt n}' to prefix a count, so the example above
Xwould be typed ``{\tt n10s}'' instead.  Commands for which counts make no
Xsense ignore them.  In addition, movement commands can be prefixed for
Xgreater control (see below).  To cancel a count or a prefix, press the
X`ESC' key.
X
X%.pg
XThe list of commands is rather long, but it can be read at any time
Xduring the game through the `{\tt ?}' command, which accesses a menu of
Xhelpful texts.  Here are the commands for your reference:
X
X\blist{}
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{?}]
XHelp menu:  display one of several help texts available.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{/}]
XTell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify a location
Xor type a symbol to define.
XTell what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify a location
Xor type a symbol (or even a whole word) to define.  If the
X%.op
X{\it help\/}
Xoption is on, and {\it NetHack\/} has some special information about an object or
Xmonster that you looked at, you'll be asked if you want ``{\tt More
Xinfo?}''.
XIf {\it help\/} is off, then you'll only get the special information if you
Xexplicitly ask for it by typing in the name of the monster or object.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{\&}]
XTell what a command does.
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{<}]
XGo up a staircase to the previous level (if you are on the stairs).
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{>}]
XGo down a staircase to the next level (if you are on the stairs).
X%.lp
X\item[\tb{[yuhjklbn]}]
XGo one step in the direction indicated (see Figure 2).  If there is
Xa monster there, you will fight the monster instead.  Only these
Xone-step movement commands cause you to fight monsters; the others
X(below) are ``safe.''
X%.sd

X\section{Rooms and corridors}
X
X%.pg
XRooms in the dungeon are either lit or dark.  If you walk into a lit
Xroom, the entire room will be drawn on the screen.  If you walk into a
Xdark room, only the areas you can see will be displayed.  In darkness,
Xyou can only see one space in all directions.  Corridors are always
Xdark, but remain on the map as you explore them.
X
X%.pg
XSecret corridors are hidden.  You can find them with the `{\tt s}' (search)
Xcommand.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Doorways (`{\tt +}')}
X
X%.pg
XDoorways connect rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no doors;
Xyou can walk right through.  Others have doors in them, which may be
Xopen, closed, or locked.  To open a closed door, use the `{\tt o}' (open)
Xcommand; to close it again, use the `{\tt c}' (close) command.
X
X%.pg
XYou can get through a locked door by using a tool to pick the lock
Xwith the `{\tt a}' (apply) command, or by kicking it open with the
X`{\tt \^{}D}' (kick) command.
X
X%.pg
XOpen doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach them
Xstraight on, horizontally or vertically.  Doorways without doors are
Xnot restricted.
X
X%.pg
XDoors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most monsters cannot
Xopen doors, although a few don't need to (ex.\ ghosts can walk through
Xdoors).
X
X%.pg
XSecret doors are hidden.  You can find them with the `{\tt s}' (search)
Xcommand.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Traps (`{\tt \^{}}')}
X
X%.pg
XThere are traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary delver.
XFor example, you may suddenly fall into a pit and be stuck for a few
Xturns.  Traps don't appear on your map until you trigger one by moving
Xonto it, or you discover it with the `{\tt s}' (search) command.  Monsters
Xcan fall prey to traps, too.
X
X%.hn 1
X\section{Monsters}
X
X%.pg
XMonsters you cannot see are not displayed on the screen.  Beware!
XYou may suddenly come upon one in a dark place.  Some magic items can
Xhelp you locate them before they locate you, which some monsters do
Xvery well.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Fighting}
X
X%.pg
XIf you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to walk
Xinto it.  Many monsters you find will mind their own business unless
Xyou attack them.  Some of them are very dangerous when angered.
XRemember:  Discretion is the better part of valor.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Your pet}
X
X%.pg
XYou start the game with a little dog (`{\tt d}') or cat (`{\tt f}'),
Xwhich follows
Xyou about the dungeon and fights monsters with you.  Like you, your
Xpet needs food to survive.  It usually feeds itself on fresh carrion
Xand other meats.  If you're worried about it or want to train it, you
Xcan feed it, too, by throwing it food.
X
X%.pg
XYour pet also gains experience from killing monsters, and can grow
Xover time, gaining hit points and doing more damage.  Initially, your
Xpet may even be better at killing things than you, which makes pets
Xuseful for low-level characters.
X
X%.pg
XYour pet will follow you up and down staircases, if it is next to you
Xwhen you move.  Otherwise, your pet will be stranded, and may become
Xwild.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Ghost levels}
X
X%.pg
XYou may encounter the shades and corpses of other adventurers (or even
Xformer incarnations of yourself!) and their personal effects.  Ghosts
Xare hard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow and do little
Xdamage.  You can plunder the deceased adventurer's possessions;
Xhowever, they are likely to be cursed.  Beware of whatever killed the
Xformer player.
X
X%.hn 1
X\section{Objects}
X
X%.pg
XWhen you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to pick
Xit up.  In {\it NetHack}, this is accomplished automatically by walking over
Xthe object (unless you turn off the
X%.op
X{\it pickup\/}
Xoption (see below), or move with the `{\tt m}' prefix (see above)), or
Xmanually by using the `{\tt ,}' command.  If you're carrying too many
Xthings, {\it NetHack\/} will tell you so and won't pick up anything more.
XOtherwise, it will add the object(s) to your pack and tell you what you
Xjust picked up.
X
X%.pg
XWhen you pick up an object, it is assigned an inventory letter.  Many
Xcommands that operate on objects must ask you to find out which object
Xyou want to use.  When {\it NetHack\/} asks you to choose a particular object
Xyou are carrying, you are usually presented with a list of inventory
Xletters to choose from (see Commands, above).
X
X%.pg
XSome objects, such as weapons, are easily differentiated.  Others, like
Xscrolls and potions, are given descriptions which vary according to
Xtype.  During a game, any two objects with the same description are
Xthe same type.  However, the descriptions will vary from game to game.
X
X%.pg
XWhen you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious, {\it NetHack\/}
Xwill remember what it is for you.  If its effect isn't extremely
Xobvious, you will be asked what you want to call this type of object
Xso you will recognize it later.  You can also use the ``{\tt \#name}''
Xcommand for the same purpose at any time, to name all objects of a
Xparticular type or just an individual object.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Curses and blessings}
X
X%.pg
XAny object that you find may be cursed, even if the object is
Xotherwise helpful.  The most common effect of a curse is being stuck
Xwith (and to) the item.  Cursed weapons weld themselves to your hand
Xwhen wielded, so you cannot unwield them.  Any cursed item you wear
Xis not removable by ordinary means.  In addition, cursed arms and armor
Xusually, but not always, bear negative enchantments that make them
Xless effective in combat.  Other cursed objects may act poorly or
Xdetrimentally in other ways.
X
X%.pg
XObjects can also become blessed.  Blessed items usually work better or
Xmore beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For example, a blessed
Xweapon will do more damage against demons.
X
X%.pg
XThere are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon objects,
Xso even if you are stuck with one, you can still have the curse
Xlifted and the item removed.  Priests and Priestesses have an innate
Xsensitivity to curses and blessings, so they can more easily avoid
Xcursed objects than other character classes.
X
X%.pg
XAn item with unknown curse status, and an item which you know to be uncursed,
Xwill be distinguished in your inventory by the presence of the word
X``uncursed'' in the description of the latter.  The exception is if this
Xdescription isn't needed; you can look at the inventory description and know
Xthat you have discovered whether it's cursed.  This applies to items which
Xhave ``plusses,'' and items with charges.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Weapons (`{\tt )}')}
X
X%.pg
XGiven a chance, almost all monsters in the Mazes of Menace will
Xgratuitously kill you.  You need weapons for self-defense (killing
Xthem first).  Without a weapon, you do only 1--2 hit points of damage
X(plus bonuses, if any).
X
X%.pg
XThere are wielded weapons, like maces and swords, and thrown weapons,
Xlike arrows.  To hit monsters with a weapon, you must wield it and
Xattack them, or throw it at them.  To shoot an arrow out of a bow, you
Xmust first wield the bow, then throw the arrow.  Crossbows shoot
Xcrossbow bolts.  Slings hurl rocks and (other) gems.  You can wield
Xonly one weapon at a time, but you can change weapons unless you're
Xwielding a cursed one.
X
X%.pg
XEnchanted weapons have a ``plus'' (which can also be a minus)
Xthat adds to your chance
Xto hit and the damage you do to a monster.  The only way to find out
Xif a weapon is enchanted is to have it magically identified somehow.
X
X%.pg
XThose of you in the audience who are AD\&D players, be aware that each
Xweapon which exists in AD\&D does the same damage to monsters in
X{\it NetHack}.  Some of the more obscure weapons (such as the %
X{\it aklys}, {\it lucern hammer}, and {\it bec-de-corbin\/}) are defined
Xin an appendix to {\it Unearthed Arcana}, an AD\&D supplement.
X
X%.pg
XThe commands to use weapons are `{\tt w}' (wield) and `{\tt t}' (throw).
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Armor (`{\tt [}')}
X
X%.pg
XLots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to protect
Xyourself from their blows.  Some types of armor offer better
Xprotection than others.  Your armor class is a measure of this
Xprotection.  Armor class (AC) is measured as in AD\&D, with 10 being
Xthe equivalent of no armor, and lower numbers meaning better armor.
XEach suit of armor which exists in AD\&D gives the same protection in
X{\it NetHack}.  Here is an (incomplete) list of the armor classes provided by
Xvarious suits of armor:
X
X\begin{center}
X\begin{tabular}{lllll}
Xdragon scale mail   & 1 & \makebox[20mm]{}  & chain mail            & 5\\
Xplate mail          & 3 &                   & scale mail            & 6\\
Xbronze plate mail   & 4 &                   & ring mail             & 7\\
Xsplint mail         & 4 &                   & studded leather armor & 7\\
Xbanded mail         & 4 &                   & leather armor         & 8\\
Xelven mithril-coat  & 5 &                   & no armor              & 10
X\end{tabular}
X\end{center}
X
X%.pg
X\nd You can also wear other pieces of armor (ex.\ helmets, boots,
Xshields, cloaks)
Xto lower your armor class even further, but you can only wear one item
Xof each category (one suit of armor, one cloak, one helmet, one
Xshield, and so on).
X
X%.pg
XIf a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will be better
X(or worse) than normal, and its ``plus'' (or minus) will subtract from
Xyour armor class.  For example, a +1 chain mail would give you
Xbetter protection than normal chain mail, lowering your armor class one
Xunit further to 4.  When you put on a piece of armor, you immediately
Xfind out the armor class and any ``plusses'' it provides.  Cursed
Xpieces of armor usually have negative enchantments (minuses) in
Xaddition to being unremovable.
X
X%.pg
XThe commands to use armor are `{\tt W}' (wear) and `{\tt T}' (take off).
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Food (`{\tt \%}')}
X
X%.pg
XFood is necessary to survive.  If you go too long without eating you
Xwill faint, and eventually die of starvation.  Unprotected food does
Xnot stay fresh indefinitely; after a while it will spoil, and be
Xunhealthy to eat.  Food stored in ice boxes or tins (``cans'' to you
XAmericans) will usually stay fresh, but ice boxes are heavy, and tins
Xtake a while to open.
X
X%.pg
XWhen you kill monsters, they usually leave corpses which are also
X``food.''  Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also give you
Xspecial powers when you eat them.  A good rule of thumb is ``you are
Xwhat you eat.''
X%.pg
XYou can name one food item after something you like to eat with the
X%.op
X{\it fruit\/} option, if your dungeon has it.
X
X%.pg
XThe command to eat food is `{\tt e}'.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Scrolls (`{\tt ?}')}
X
X%.pg
XScrolls are labeled with various titles, probably chosen by ancient wizards
Xfor their amusement value (ex.\ ``READ ME,'' or ``HOLY BIBLE'' backwards).
XScrolls disappear after you read them (except for blank ones, without
Xmagic spells on them).
X
X%.pg
XOne of the most useful of these is the %
X{\it scroll of identify}, which
Xcan be used to determine what another object is, whether it is cursed or
Xblessed, and how many uses it has left.  Some objects of subtle
Xenchantment are difficult to identify without these.
X
X%.pg
XIf you receive mail while you are playing (on
Xversions compiled with this feature), a mail daemon may run up and
Xdeliver it to you as a %
X{\it scroll of mail}.  To use this feature,
Xyou must let {\it NetHack\/} know where to look for new mail by setting the
X``MAIL'' environment variable to the file name of your mailbox.  You
Xmay also want to set the ``MAILREADER'' environment variable to the
Xfile name of your favorite reader, so {\it NetHack\/} can shell to it when you
Xread the scroll.
X
X%.pg
XThe command to read a scroll is `{\tt r}'.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Potions (`{\tt !}')}
X
X%.pg
XPotions are distinguished by the color of the liquid inside the flask.
XThey disappear after you quaff them.
X
X%.pg
XClear potions are potions of water.  Sometimes these are
Xblessed or cursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.  Holy water is
Xthe bane of the undead, so potions of holy water are good thing to
Xthrow (`{\tt t}') at them.  It also is very useful when you dip
X(``{\tt \#dip}'') other
Xobjects in it.
X
X%.pg
XThe command to drink a potion is `{\tt q}' (quaff).
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Wands (`{\tt /}')}
X
X%.pg
XMagic wands have multiple magical charges.  Some wands are
Xdirectional---you must give a direction to zap them in.  You can also
Xzap them at yourself (just give a `{\tt .}' or `{\tt s}' for the direction),
Xbut it is often unwise.  Other wands are nondirectional---they don't ask
Xfor directions.  The number of charges in a wand is random, and
Xdecreases by one whenever you use it.
X
X%.pg
XThe command to use a wand is `{\tt z}' (zap).
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Rings (`{\tt =}')}
X
X%.pg
XRings are very useful items, since they are relatively permanent
Xmagic, unlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and
Xwands.
XPutting on a ring activates its magic.  You can wear only two
Xrings, one on each ring finger.
XMost rings also cause you to grow hungry more rapidly, the rate
Xvarying with the type of ring.
X
X%.pg
XThe commands to use rings are `{\tt P}' (put on) and `{\tt R}' (remove).
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Spellbooks (`{\tt +}')}
X
X%.pg
XSpellbooks are tomes of mighty magic.  When studied with the `{\tt r}' (read)
Xcommand, they bestow the knowledge of a spell---unless the attempt
Xbackfires.
XReading a cursed spell book, or one with mystic runes beyond
Xyour ken can be harmful to your health!
X
X%.pg
XA spell can also backfire when you cast it.  If you attempt to cast a
Xspell well above your experience level, or cast it at a time when your
Xluck is particularly bad, you can end up wasting both the energy and
Xthe time required in casting.
X
X%.pg
XCasting a spell calls forth magical energies and focuses them with
Xyour naked mind.  Releasing the magical energy releases some of your
Xmemory of the spell with it.  Each time you cast a spell, your
Xfamiliarity with it will dwindle, until you eventually forget the
Xdetails completely and must relearn it.
X
X%.pg
XThe command to read a spellbook is the same as for scrolls, `{\tt r}'
X(read).  The `{\tt +}' command lists your current spells and the number of
Xspell points they require.  The `{\tt Z}' (cast) command casts a spell.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Tools (`{\tt (}')}
X
X%.pg
XTools are miscellaneous objects with various purposes.  Some tools,
Xlike wands, have a limited number of uses.  For example, lamps burn
Xout after a while.  Other tools are containers, which objects can
Xbe placed into or taken out of.
X
X%.pg
XThe command to use tools is `{\tt a}' (apply).
X
X%.hn 3
X\subsection*{Chests and boxes}
X
X%.pg
XYou may encounter chests or boxes in your travels.  These can be
Xopened with the ``{\tt \#loot}'' extended command when they are on the floor,
Xor with the `{\tt a}' (apply) command when you are carrying one.  However,
Xchests are often locked, and require you to either use a key to unlock
Xit, a tool to pick the lock, or to break it open with brute force.
XChests are unwieldy objects, and must be set down to be unlocked (by
Xkicking them, using a key or lock picking tool with the `{\tt a}' (apply)
Xcommand, or by using a weapon to force the lock with the ``{\tt \#force}''
Xextended command).
X
X%.pg
XSome chests are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when you
Xunlock or open them.  You can check for and try to deactivate traps
Xwith the ``{\tt \#untrap}'' extended command.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Amulets (`{\tt "}')}
X
X%.pg
XAmulets are very similar to rings, and often more powerful.  Like
Xrings, amulets have various magical properties, some beneficial,
Xsome harmful, which are activated by putting them on.
X
X%.pg
XThe commands to use amulets are the same as for rings, `{\tt P}' (put on)
Xand `{\tt R}' (remove).
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Gems (`{\tt *}')}
X
X%.pg
XSome gems are valuable, and can be sold for a lot of gold pieces.
XValuable gems increase your score if you bring them with you when you
Xexit.  Other small rocks are also categorized as gems, but they are
Xmuch less valuable.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Large rocks (`{\tt `}')}
X%.pg
XStatues and boulders are not particularly useful, and are generally
Xheavy.  It is rumored that some statues are not what they seem.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Gold (`{\tt \$}')}
X
X%.pg
XGold adds to your score, and you can buy things in shops with it.
XYour version of {\it NetHack\/} may display how much gold you have on the
Xstatus line.  If not, the `{\tt \$}' command will count it.
X
X%.hn 1
X\section{Options}
X
X%.pg
XDue to variations in personal tastes and conceptions of how {\it NetHack\/}
Xshould do things, there are options you can set to change how {\it NetHack\/}
Xbehaves.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Setting the options}
X
X%.pg
XThere are two ways to set the options.  The first is with the `{\tt O}'
Xcommand in {\it NetHack}; the second is with the ``NETHACKOPTIONS''
Xenvironment variable.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable}
X
X%.pg
XThe NETHACKOPTIONS variable is a comma-separated list of initial
Xvalues for the various options.  Some can only be turned on or off.
XYou turn one of these on by adding the name of the option to the list,
Xand turn it off by typing a `{\tt !}' or ``{\tt no}'' before the name.
XOthers take a
Xcharacter string as a value.  You can set string options by typing
Xthe option name, a colon, and then the value of the string.  The value
Xis terminated by the next comma or the end of string.
X
X%.pg
XFor example, to set up an environment variable in UNIX so that {\it female\/}
Xis on, {\it pickup\/} is off, the {\it name\/} is set to ``Blue Meanie'', and
Xthe {\it fruit\/} is set to ``papaya'', you would enter the command
X%.sd
X\begin{verbatim}
X    setenv NETHACKOPTIONS "female,!pickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"
X\end{verbatim}
X%.ed
X
X\nd in {\it csh}, or
X%.sd
X\begin{verbatim}
X    NETHACKOPTIONS="female,!pickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"
X    export NETHACKOPTIONS
X\end{verbatim}
X%.ed
X
X\nd in {\it sh\/} or {\it ksh}.
X
X%.hn 2
X\subsection*{Customization options}
X
X%.pg
XHere are explanations of the various options do.  Character strings
Xlonger than fifty characters are truncated.  Some of the options
Xlisted may be inactive in your dungeon.
X
X\blist{}
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{catname}]
XName your starting cat (ex.\ ``{\tt catname:Morris}'').
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{color}]
XUse color for different monsters, objects, and dungeon features (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{confirm}]
XHave user confirm attacks on pets, shopkeepers, and other
Xpeaceable creatures (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{DECgraphics}]
XUse a predefined selection of characters from the DEC VT-xxx/DEC Rainbow/
XANSI line-drawing character set to display the dungeon instead of having
Xto define a full graphics set yourself (default off).
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{dogname}]
XName your starting dog (ex.\ ``{\tt dogname:Fang}'').
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{endgame}]
XControl what parts of the score list you are shown at the end (ex.\
X``{\tt endgame:5top scores/4around my score/own scores}'').  Only the first
Xletter of each category (`{\tt t}', `{\tt a}' or `{\tt o}') is necessary.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{female}]
XSet your sex (default off). Cannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{fixinvlet}]
XAn object's inventory letter sticks to it when it's dropped (default on).
XIf this is off, dropping an object shifts all the remaining inventory letters.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{fruit}]
XName a fruit after something you enjoy eating (ex.\ ``{\tt fruit:mango}'')
X(default ``{\tt slime mold}''). Basically a nostalgic whimsy that
X{\it NetHack\/} uses from time to time.  You should set this to something you
Xfind more appetizing than slime mold.  Apples, oranges, pears, bananas, and
Xmelons already exist in {\it NetHack}, so don't use those.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{graphics}]
XSet the graphics symbols for screen displays (default
X``\verb&|--------|||-\/.-|+.#<>& \verb&^"}{#\_<>##&''). The
X%.op
X{\it graphics\/}
Xoption (if used) should come last, followed by a string of up to 35
Xcharacters to be used instead of the default map-drawing characters.
XThe dungeon map will use the characters you specify instead of the
Xdefault symbols.
X
XThe
X%.op
X{\it DECgraphics}
Xand
X%.op
X{\it IBMgraphics}
Xoptions use predefined selections of graphics symbols, so you need not
Xgo to the trouble of setting up a full graphics string for these common
Xcases.  These two options also set up proper handling of graphics
Xcharacters for such terminals, so you should specify them as appropriate
Xeven if you override the selections with your own graphics string.
X
XNote that this option string is now escape-processed in conventional C
Xfashion.  This means that `\verb+\+' is a prefix to take the following
Xcharacter literally, and not as a special prefix.  Your graphics
Xstrings for {\it NetHack\/} 2.2 and older versions may contain a `\verb+\+';
Xit must be doubled for the same effect now.  The special escape form
X`\verb+\m+' switches on the meta bit in the following character, and the
X`{\tt \^{}}' prefix causes the following character to be treated as a control
Xcharacter (so any `{\tt \^{}}' in your old graphics strings should be changed
Xto `\verb+\^+' now).

XThe order of the symbols is:  solid rock, vertical wall, horizontal
Xwall, upper left corner, upper right corner, lower left corner, lower
Xright corner, cross wall, upward T wall, downward T wall, leftward T
Xwall, rightward T wall, vertical beam, horizontal beam, left slant,
Xright slant, no door, vertical open door, horizontal open door, closed
Xdoor, floor of a room, corridor, stairs up, stairs down, trap, web,
Xpool or moat, fountain, kitchen sink, throne, altar, ladder up, ladder
Xdown, vertical drawbridge, horizontal drawbridge.
XYou might want to use `{\tt +}' for the corners and T walls for a more
Xesthetic, boxier display.  Note that in the next release, new symbols
Xmay be added, or the present ones rearranged.
X
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{help}]
XIf more information is available for an object looked at
Xwith the `{\tt /}' command, ask if you want to see it (default on). Turning help
Xoff makes just looking at things faster, since you aren't interrupted with the
X``{\tt More info?}'' prompt, but it also means that you might miss some
Xinteresting and/or important information.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{IBM\_BIOS}]
XUse BIOS calls to update the screen display quickly and to read the keyboard
X(allowing the use of arrow keys to move) on machines with an IBM PC
Xcompatible BIOS ROM (default off, {\it PC\/ {\rm and} ST NetHack\/} only).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{IBMgraphics}]
XUse a predefined selection of IBM extended ASCII characters to display the
Xdungeon instead of having to define a full graphics set yourself (default off).
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{ignintr}]
XIgnore interrupt signals, including breaks (default off).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{male}]
XSet your sex (default on, most hackers are male).
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{name}]
XSet your character's name (defaults to your user name).  You can also
Xset your character class by appending a dash and the first letter of
Xthe character class (that is, by suffixing one of
X``{\tt -A -B -C -E -H -K -P -R -S -T -V -W}'').
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{news}]
XRead the {\it NetHack\/} news file, if present (default on).
XSince the news is shown at the beginning of the game, there's no point
Xin setting this with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{number\_pad}]
XUse the number keys to move instead of {\tt [yuhjklbn]} (default off).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{null}]
XSend padding nulls to the terminal (default off).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{packorder}]
XSpecify the order to list object types in (default
X``\verb&\")[\%?+/=!(*'0_&''). The value of this option should be a string
Xcontaining the symbols for the various object types.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{pickup}]
XPick up things you move onto by default (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{rawio}]
XForce raw (non-cbreak) mode for faster output and more
Xbulletproof input (MS-DOS sometimes treats `{\tt \^{}P}' as a printer toggle
Xwithout it) (default off).  Note:  DEC Rainbows hang if this is turned on.
XCannot be set with the `{\tt O}' command.
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{rest\_on\_space}]
XMake the space bar a synonym for the `{\tt .}' (rest) command (default off).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{safe\_pet}]
XPrevent you from (knowingly) attacking your pets (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{silent}]
XSuppress terminal beeps (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{sortpack}]
XSort the pack contents by type when displaying inventory (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{standout}]
XBoldface monsters and ``{\tt --More--}'' (default off).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{time}]
XShow the elapsed game time in turns on bottom line (default off).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{tombstone}]
XDraw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).
X%.lp
X\item[\ib{verbose}]
XProvide more commentary during the game (default on).

X\section{Scoring}
X
X%.pg
X{\it NetHack\/} maintains a list of the top scores or scorers on your machine,
Xdepending on how it is set up.  In the latter case, each account on
Xthe machine can post only one non-winning score on this list.  If
Xyou score higher than someone else on this list, or better your
Xprevious score, you will be inserted in the proper place under your
Xcurrent name.  How many scores are kept can also be set up when
X{\it NetHack\/} is compiled.
X
X%.pg
XYour score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how
Xmuch loot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game
Xended.  If you quit the game, you escape with all of your gold intact.
XIf, however, you get killed in the Mazes of Menace, the guild will
Xonly hear about 90\,\% of your gold when your corpse is discovered
X(adventurers have been known to collect finder's fees).  So, consider
Xwhether you want to take one last hit at that monster and possibly
Xlive, or quit and stop with whatever you have.  If you quit, you keep
Xall your gold, but if you swing and live, you might find more.
X
X%.pg
XIf you just want to see what the current top players/games list is, you
Xcan type
X\begin{verbatim}
X    nethack -s all
X\end{verbatim}

X\section{Explore mode}
X
X%.pg
X{\it NetHack\/} is an intricate and difficult game.  Novices might falter
Xin fear, aware of their ignorance of the means to survive.  Well, fear
Xnot.  Your dungeon may come equipped with an ``explore'' or ``discovery''
Xmode that enables you to keep old save files and cheat death, at the
Xpaltry cost of not getting on the high score list.
X
X%.pg
XThere are two ways of enabling explore mode.  One is to start the game
Xwith the
X%.op
X{\tt -X}
Xswitch.  The other is to issue the `{\tt X}' command while already playing
Xthe game.  The other benefits of explore mode are left for the trepid
Xreader to discover.

X\section{Credits}
X%.pg
XThe original %
X{\it hack\/} game was modeled on the Berkeley UNIX
X%.ux
X{\it rogue\/} game.  Large portions of this paper were shamelessly
Xcribbed from %
X{\it A Guide to the Dungeons of Doom}, by Michael C. Toy
Xand Kenneth C. R. C. Arnold.  Small portions were adapted from
X{\it Further Exploration of the Dungeons of Doom}, by Ken Arromdee.
X
X%.pg
X{\it NetHack\/} is the product of literally dozens of people's work.
XMain events in the course of the game development are described below:
X
X%.pg
X\bigskip
X\nd {\it Jay Fenlason\/} wrote the original {\it Hack\/} with help from {\it
XKenny Woodland}, {\it Mike Thome}, and {\it Jon Payne}.
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd {\it Andries Brouwer\/} did a major re-write, transforming {\it Hack\/}
Xinto a very different game, and published (at least) three versions (1.0.1,
X1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for UNIX machines to the Usenet.
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd {\it Don G. Kneller\/} ported {\it Hack\/} 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and MS-DOS,
Xproducing {\it PC Hack\/} 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in
Xversion 1.03g, and went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2,
X3.51, and 3.6).
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd {\it R. Black\/} ported {\it PC Hack\/} 3.51 to Lattice C and the Atari
X520/1040ST, producing {\it ST Hack\/} 1.03.
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd {\it Mike Stephenson\/} merged these various versions back together,
Xincorporating many of the added features, and produced {\it NetHack\/} version
X1.4.  He then coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging
X{\it NetHack\/} 1.4 and released {\it NetHack\/} versions 2.2 and 2.3.
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which
Xincluded {\it Ken Arromdee}, {\it Jean-Christophe Collet}, {\it Steve Creps},
X{\it Eric Hendrickson}, {\it Izchak Miller}, {\it Eric S. Raymond}, {\it John
XRupley}, {\it Mike Threepoint}, and {\it Janet Walz}, to produce {\it
XNetHack\/} 3.0c.
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd {\it NetHack\/} 3.0 was ported to the Atari by {\it Eric R. Smith}, to OS/2 by
X{\it Timo Hakulinen}, and to VMS by {\it David Gentzel}.  The three of them
Xand {\it Kevin Darcy\/} later joined the main development team to produce
Xsubsequent revisions of 3.0.
X
X%.pg
X\medskip
X\nd {\it Olaf Seibert\/} ported {\it NetHack\/} 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.  {\it
XNorm Meluch}, {\it Stephen Spackman\/} and {\it Pierre Martineau\/} designed
Xoverlay code for {\it PC NetHack\/} 3.0.  {\it Johnny Lee\/} ported {\it
XNetHack\/} 3.0 to the Macintosh.  Along with various other Dungeoneers, they
Xcontinued to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga ports through the later
Xrevisions of 3.0.
X
X%.pg
X\bigskip
X\nd From time to time, some depraved individual out there in netland sends a
Xparticularly intriguing modification to help out with the game.  The Gods of
Xthe Dungeon sometimes make note of the names of the worst of these miscreants
Xin this, the list of Dungeoneers:
