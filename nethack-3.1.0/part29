XYou find yourself standing in sight of %H.  Something
Xis obviously wrong here.  The doors to %H, which usually
Xstand open, are closed.  Strange human shapes shamble around
Xoutside.
X
XYou realize that the %l needs your assistance!
X%E
X%Cp P 00002
XOnce again, you stand before %H.
X%E
X%Cp P 00003
XAgain you face %H.  Your intuition hints that this may be
Xthe final time you come here.
X%E
X%Cp P 00005
XGreetings, honored %r.  It is good to see you.
X%E
X%Cp P 00006
XAh, %p!  Surely you can help us in our hour of need.
X%E
X%Cp P 00007
XGreetings, %s.  The %l has great need of your help.
X%E
X%Cp P 00008
XAlas, it seems as if even %d has deserted us.
X%E
X%Cp P 00009
XMay %d be with you, %s.
X%E
X%Cc P 00010
XAh, %p, my %S.  You have returned to us at last.
XA great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
XFirst, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this
Xgreat challenge.
X%E
X%Cp P 00011
XAgain, my %S, you stand before me.  Are you ready now to help us?
X%E
X%Cp P 00012
XOnce more, %p, you stand within the sanctum.  Are you ready now?
X%E
X%Cc P 00013
XYou are a heretic, %p!  How can you, a %r, deviate so from the
Xteachings of %d?  Begone from this temple.  You are no longer
Xa %s to this order.  We will pray to %d for other assistance,
Xas you have failed us utterly.
X%E
X%Cc P 00014
XAlas, %p, it is not yet to be.  A mere %r could never
Xwithstand the might of %n.  Go forth, again into the world, and return
Xwhen you have attained the post of %R.
X%E
X%Cc P 00015
XThis is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the true path!
XYou know that %d requires the most strident devotion of this
Xorder.  The %shood must stand for utmost piety.
X
XGo from here, atone for your sins against %d.  Return only when
Xyou have purified yourself.
X%E
X%Cc P 00016
XYes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
Xtell you of what has transpired:
X
XAt one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, %n and a legion
Xof undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
Xthe one carrying %o.
X
XAs a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
XWithout it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
Xbarely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.
X
XWe need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
Xto %n's lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
X%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
Xundead that befoul the land.
X
XGo with %d as your guide, %p.
X%E
X%Cp P 00020
XYou can prevail, if you rely on %d.
X%E
X%Cp P 00021
XRemember that %n has great magic at his command.
X%E
X%Cp P 00022
XBe pure, my %S.
X%E
X%Cp P 00023
XBeware, %i is surrounded by a great graveyard.
X%E
X%Cp P 00024
XYou may be able to affect %n with magical cold.
X%E
X%Cp P 00025
XAcquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
Xagainst %n.
X%E
X%Cp P 00026
XCall upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered.
X%E
X%Cp P 00027
XThe undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours.
X%E
X%Cp P 00028
XDo not loose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger.
X%E
X%Cp P 00029
XWear %o.  It will assist you against the undead.
X%E
X%Cc P 00030
XYou stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
Xthat seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
Xundead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.
X
XYou remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
Xthe %l.  It is ahead that you will find %n's trail.
X%E
X%Cp P 00031
XAgain, you stand before %i.
X%E
X%Cc P 00040
XThe stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
Xof tortured souls assault your psyche.
X
XAhead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
X%E
X%Cp P 00041
XAgain, you have invaded %n's domain.
X%E
X%Cc P 00050
XAh, so the %l has sent another %g to retrieve
X%o.
X
XNo, I see you are no %g.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
Xafter all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
X%o.
X%E
X%Cp P 00051
XSo, %r.  Again you challenge me.
X%E
X%Cp P 00052
XDie now, %r.  %d has no power here to aid you.
X%E
X%Cp P 00053
XYou shall die, %r, and I will have %o back.
X%E
X%Cp P 00060
XSubmit to my will, %c, and I shall spare you.
X%E
X%Cp P 00061
XYour puny powers are no match for me, %c.
X%E
X%Cp P 00062
XI shall have you turned into a zombie for my pleasure!
X%E
X%Cp P 00063
XDespair now, %r.  %d cannot help you.
X%E
X%Cp P 00064
XI shall feast upon your soul for many days, %c.
X%E
X%Cp P 00065
XYour death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!
X%E
X%Cp P 00066
XYou cannot defeat %n, you fool.  I shall kill you now.
X%E
X%Cp P 00067
XYour precious %l will be my next victim.
X%E
X%Cp P 00068
XI feel your powers failing you, %r.  You shall die now.
X%E
X%Cp P 00069
XWith %o, nothing can stand in my way.
X%E
X%Cc P 00070
XAs you pick up %o, you feel the essence of
X%d fill your soul.  You know now why %n stole it from
X%H, for with it, a %c of %d could
Xeasily defeat his plans.
X
XYou sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
Xget the impression that you must return to the %l as soon
Xas possible.
X%E
X%Cc P 00080
XYou feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %n's body dissolves
Xinto a cloud of noxious gas.
X
XSuddenly, a voice booms out:
X
X    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.
X    Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
X    As for you, %n, I shall deal with thy failure
X    at my leisure.
X
XYou then hear the voice of %n, screaming in terror...
X%E
X%Cc P 00081
XYou have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
XCongratulations.
X
XI have been in meditation, and have received direction from
Xa minion of %d.  %d commands that you retain
X%o.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
Xof Yendor.
X
XGo forth, and let %d guide your steps.
X%E
X%Cp P 00090
XWelcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?
X%E
X%Cc P 00091
XYou have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,
Xyou must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on %d's altar on
Xthe Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this
Xlife, but I hope to at %d's feet.

X%Cc R 00001
XUnexpectedly, you find yourself back in Ransmannsby, where you trained to
Xbe a thief.  Quickly you make the guild sign, hoping that you AND word
Xof your arrival reach the %l's den.
X%E
X%Cp R 00002
XOnce again, you find yourself back in Ransmannsby.  Fond memories are
Xreplaced by fear, knowing that the %l is waiting for you.
X%E
X%Cp R 00003
XYou rub your hands through your hair, hoping that the little ones on
Xthe back of your neck stay down, and prepare yourself for your meeting
Xwith the %l.
X%E
X%Cp R 00005
XI hear that Lady Tyvefelle's household is lightly guarded.
X%E
X%Cp R 00006
XYou're back?  Even the Twain don't come back anymore.
X%E
X%Cp R 00007
XCan you spare an old cutpurse a zorkmid for some grog?
X%E
X%Cp R 00008
XFritz tried to join the other side, and now he's hell-hound chow.
X%E
X%Cp R 00009
XBe careful what you steal, I hear the boss has perfected turning
Xrocks into worthless pieces of glass.
X%E
X%Cc R 00010
XWell, look who it is boys -- %p has come home.  You seem to have
Xfallen behind in your dues.  I should kill you as an example to these
Xother worthless cutpurses, but I have a better plan.  If you are ready
Xmaybe you could work off your back dues by performing a little job for
Xme.  Let us just see if you are ready...
X%E
X%Cp R 00011
XWell, I didn't expect to see you back.  It shows that you are either stupid,
Xor you are finally ready to accept my offer.  Let us hope for your sake it
Xisn't stupidity that brings you back.
X%E
X%Cp R 00012
XDid you perhaps mistake me for some other %l?  You must
Xthink me as stupid as your behavior.  I warn you not to try my patience.
X%E
X%Cc R 00013
XWell %gp, it looks like our friend has forgotten who is the boss
Xaround here.  Our friend seems to think that %rp have been put in
Xcharge.  Wrong.  DEAD WRONG!
X
XYour sudden shift in surroundings prevents you from hearing the end
Xof the %l's curse.
X%E
X%Cc R 00014
XIn the time that you've been gone you've only been able to master the
Xarts of a %r?  I've trained ten times again as many %Rp
Xin that time.  Maybe I should send one of them, no?  Where would that
Xleave you, %p?  Oh yeah, I remember, I was going to kill you!
X%E
X%Cc R 00015
XMaybe I should chain you to my perch here for a while.  Perhaps watching
Xreal %A men at work will bring some sense back to you.  I don't
Xthink I could stand the sight of you for that long though.  Come back
Xwhen you can be trusted to act properly.
X%E
X%Cc R 00016
XWill everyone not going to retrieve %o from that
Xjerk, the %n, take one step backwards.  Good choice,
X%p, because I was going to send you anyway.  My other %gp
Xare too valuable to me.
X
XHere's the deal.  I want %o, the %n
Xhas %o.  You are going to get %o
Xand bring it back to me.  So simple an assignment even you can understand
Xit.
X%E
X%Cc R 00020
XYou don't seem to understand, %o isn't here so
Xneither should you be!
X%E
X%Cp R 00021
XMay %d curse you with lead fingers.  Get going!
X%E
X%Cp R 00022
XWe don't have all year.  GET GOING!
X%E
X%Cc R 00023
XHow would you like a scar necklace?  I'm just the jeweler to do it!
X%E
X%Cp R 00024
XLazy S.O.B.  Maybe I should call up someone else...
X%E
X%Cp R 00025
XMaybe I should open your skull and see if my instructions are inside?
X%E
X%Cp R 00026
XThis is not a task you can complete in the afterlife, you know.
X%E
X%Cc R 00027
XInside every living person is a dead person trying to get out, and I have
Xyour key!
X%E
X%Cp R 00028
XWe're almost out of hell-hound chow, so why don't you just get moving!
X%E
X%Cp R 00029
XYou know, %o isn't going to come when you
Xwhistle.  You must get it yourself.
X%E
X%Cp R 00030
XThose damn little hairs tell you that you are nearer to
X%o.
X%E
X%Cp R 00031
XNot wanting to face the %l without having stolen
X%o, you continue.
X%E
X%Cc R 00040
XYou feel a great swelling up of courage, sensing the presence of
X%o.  Or is it fear?
X%E
X%Cp R 00041
XThe hairs on the back of your neck whisper -- it's fear.
X%E
X%Cc R 00050
XAh!  You must be the %l's ... er, "hero".  A pleasure
Xto meet you.
X%E
X%Cc R 00051
XWe meet again.  Please reconsider your actions.
X%E
X%Cp R 00052
XSurely, %p, you have learned that you can not trust any bargains
Xthat the %l has made.  I can show you how to continue on
Xyour quest without having to run into him again.
X%E
X%Cp R 00053
XPlease, think for a moment about what you are doing.  Do you truly
Xbelieve that %d would want the %l to have
X%o?
X%E
X%Cp R 00060
XMay I suggest a compromise.  Are you interested in gold or gems?
X%E
X%Cp R 00061
XPlease don't force me to kill you.
X%E
X%Cp R 00062
XGrim times are upon us all.  Will you not see reason?
X%E
X%Cp R 00063
XI knew the %l, and you're no %l, thankfully.
X%E
X%Cp R 00064
XIt is a shame that we are not meeting under more pleasant circumstances.
X%E
X%Cp R 00065
XI was once like you are now, %p.  Believe in me -- our way
Xis better.
X%E
X%Cp R 00066
XStay with me, and I will make you %o's guardian.
X%E
X%Cp R 00067
XWhen you return, with or without %o,
Xthe %l will have you killed.
X%E
X%Cp R 00068
XDo not be fooled; I am prepared to kill to defend %o.
X%E
X%Cp R 00069
XI can reunite you with the Twain.  Oh, the stories you can swap.
X%E
X%Cc R 00070
XAs you pick up %o, the hairs on the back of your
Xneck fall out.  At once you you realize why the %n was
Xwilling to die to keep it out of the %l's hands.  Somehow
Xyou know that you must do likewise.
X%E
X%Cc R 00080
XI know what you are thinking, %p.  It is not too late for you
Xto use %o wisely.  For the sake of your guild
X%sp, do what is right.
X
XYou sit and wait for death to come for the %n, and then you
Xbrace yourself for your next meeting with the %l!
X%E
X%Cc R 00081
XWell, I'll be damned.  You got it.  I am proud of you, a fine %r
Xyou've turned out to be.
X
XWhile you were gone I got to thinking, you and %o
Xtogether could bring me more treasure than either of you apart, so why don't
Xyou take it with you.  All I ask is a cut of whatever loot you come by.
XThat is a better deal than I offered the %n.
X
XBut, you see what happened to the %n when he refused.
XDon't make me find another to send after you this time.
X%E
X%Cc R 00090
XQuite the little thief, aren't we, %p.  Can I interest you in a
Xswap for %o.  Look around, anything in the keep
Xis yours for the asking.
X%E
X%Cc R 00091
XI see that with your abilities, and my brains, we could rule this world.
X
XAll that we would need to be all-powerful is for you to take that little
Xtrinket you've got there up to the Astral plane.  From there, %d will
Xshow you what to do with it.  Once that's done, we will be invincible!

X%Cc S 00001
XEven before your senses adjust, you recognize the kami of
X%H.
X
XBut why is the standard of your teki, %n, flying
Xabove the town?  Why are ronin wandering freely, where are the
Xsamurai of your daimyo, %l?
X
XYou quickly say a prayer to Izanagi and Izanami and walk towards
Xtown.
X%E
X%Cp S 00002
XOnce again, you are back at %H.
X%E
X%Cp S 00003
XYou are back at %H.
X
XInstantly you sense a subtle change in your karma.  You seem to know that
Xif you do not succeed in your quest, %n will have destroyed
Xthe kami of %H before you return again.
X%E
X%Cp S 00005
XTo succeed, you must walk like a butterfly on the wind.
X%E
X%Cp S 00006
XIkaga desu ka?
X%E
X%Cp S 00007
XI fear for The Land of The Gods.
X%E
X%Cp S 00008
X%n has hired the Ninja -- be careful.
X%E
X%Cp S 00009
XIf %o is not returned, we will all be ronin.
X%E
X%Cc S 00010
XAh, %p-san, it is good to see you again.  I need someone who can
Xlead my samurai against %n.  If you are ready, you will be
Xthat person.
X%E
X%Cp S 00011
XOnce again, %p-san, you kneel before me.  Are you yet capable of
Xbeing my vassal?
X%E
X%Cp S 00012
XYou begin to test my matsu, %p-san.
XIf you cannot determine what I want in a samurai, how can I rely on you
Xto figure out what I need from a samurai?
X%E
X%Cp S 00013
XYou are no longer my samurai, %p.
X
XHara-kiri is denied.  You are ordered to shave your head and then to
Xbecome a monk.  Your fief and family are forfeit.  Wakarimasu?
X%E
X%Cp S 00014
X%p-san, you have learned well and honored your family.
XI require the skills of a %R in order to defeat %n.
XGo and seek out teachers.  Learn what they have learned.  When you
Xare ready, return to me.
X%E
X%Cp S 00015
X%p-san, you are no better than eta!
X
XYou have skills, but until you can call upon the bushido to know when and
Xhow to use them you are not samurai.  When you can think %A and
Xact %A then return.
X%E
X%Cc S 00016
XTomo %p-san, indeed you are ready.  I can now tell you what
Xit is that I require of you.
X
XThe daimyo, %n, has betrayed us.  He has stolen from us
X%o and taken it to his donjon deep within
X%i.
X
XIf I can not show the emperor %o when he comes
Xfor the festival he will know that I have failed in my duty, and
Xrequest that I commit seppuku.
X
XYou must gain entrance to %i and retrieve the
Xemperor's property.  Be quick!  The emperor will be here for the
Xcha-no-you in 5 sticks.
X
XWakarimasu?
X%E
X%Cp S 00020
XTo defeat %n you must overcome the seven emotions:
Xhate, adoration, joy, anxiety, anger, grief, and fear.
X%E
X%Cp S 00021
XRemember your honor is my honor, you perform in my name.
X%E
X%Cp S 00022
XI will go to the temple and burn incense for your safe return.
X%E
X%Cp S 00023
XSayonara.
X%E
X%Cp S 00024
XThere can be honor in defeat, but no gain.
X%E
X%Cp S 00025
XYour kami must be strong in order to succeed.
X%E
X%Cp S 00026
XYou are indeed a worthy %R, but now you must be a worthy samurai.
X%E
X%Cp S 00027
XIf you fail, %n will be like a tai-fun on the land.
X%E
X%Cp S 00028
XIf you are truly %A, %d will listen.
X%E
X%Cp S 00029
XSharpen your swords and your wits for the task before you.
X%E
X%Cc S 00030
XYou instinctively reach for your swords.  You do not recognize the
Xlay of this land, but you know that your teki are everywhere.
X%E
X%Cp S 00031
XThankful that your %sp at %H cannot see
Xyour fear, you prepare again to advance.
X%E
X%Cc S 00040
XIn your mind, you hear the taunts of %n.
X
XYou become like the rice plant and bend to the ground, offering a
Xprayer to %d.  But when the wind has passed, you stand
Xproudly again.  Putting your kami in the hands of fate, you advance.
X%E
X%Cp S 00041
XAs you arrive once again at the home of %n, your thoughts
Xturn only to %o.
X%E
X%Cp S 00050
XAh, so it is to be you, %p-san.  I offer you seppuku.
XI will be your second if you wish.
X%E
X%Cp S 00051
XI have offered you the honorable exit.  Now I will have your
Xhead to send unwashed to %l.
X%E
X%Cp S 00052
XAfter I have dispatched you, I will curse your kami.
X%E
X%Cp S 00053
XYou have fought my samurai; surely you must know that you
Xwill not be able to take %o back to
X%H.
X%E
X%Cp S 00060
X%l may not know eta when he sees one, but I do!
X%E
X%Cp S 00061
XThere is no honor for me in your death.
X%E
X%Cp S 00062
XYou know that I can not resash my swords until they have killed.
X%E
X%Cp S 00063
XYour presence only compounds the dishonor of %l in not coming himself.
X%E
X%Cp S 00064
XI will make tea with your hair and serve it to %l.
X%E
X%Cp S 00065
XYour fear shows in your eyes, coward!
X%E
X%Cp S 00066
XI have not heard of you, %p-san; has your life been that unworthy?
X%E
X%Cp S 00067
XIf you will not obey me, you will die.
X%E
X%Cp S 00068
XKneel now and make the two cuts of honor.  I will tell your %sp
Xof your honorable death.
X%E
X%Cp S 00069
XYour master was a poor teacher.  You will pay for his mistakes in
Xyour teaching.
X%E
X%Cc S 00070
XAs you pick up %o, you feel the strength of its karma.
XYou realize at once why so many good samurai had to die to defend it.
XYou are humbled knowing that you hold one of the artifacts of the
Xsun god.
X%E
X%Cc S 00080
XYour healing skills tell you that %n's wounds are mortal.
X
XYou know that the bushido tells you to finish him and let his kami
Xdie with honor, but the thought of so many samurai dead due to this
Xman's dishonor prevents you from giving the final blow.
X
XYou order that his unwashed head be given to the crows and his body
Xthrown into the sea.
X%E
X%Cc S 00081
XAs you bow before %l, he welcomes you:

XYou have brought your family great honor, %p-sama.
X
XWhile you have been gone the emperor's advisors have discovered in the
Xancient texts that the karma of the samurai who seeks to recover the
Xamulet and the karma of %o are joined as the seasons
Xjoin to make a year.
X
XBecause you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests that you
Xtake leave of other obligations and continue on the road that fate
Xhas set your feet upon.  I would consider it an honor if you would
Xallow me to watch your household until you return with the amulet.
X
XWith that, %l bows, and places his sword atop
X%o.
X%E
X%Cp S 00090
X%l bows.  %p-sama, tell us of your search for the Amulet.
X%E
X%Cc S 00091
XAh, %p-sama.  You have wasted your efforts returning home.
XNow that you are in possession of the Amulet, you are honor-bound to
Xfinish the quest you have undertaken.  There will be plenty of time
Xfor saki and stories when you have finished.
X
XGo now, and may our prayers be a wind at your back.

XYou breathe a sigh of relief as you find yourself back in the familiar
Xsurroundings of %H.
X
XYou quickly notice that things do not appear the way they did when you
Xleft.  The town is dark and quiet.  There are no sounds coming from
Xbehind the town walls, and no campfires burning in the fields.  As a
Xmatter of fact, you do not %x any movement in the fields at all, and
Xthe crops look as though they have been untended for many weeks.
X%E

XOnce again, you are back at %H.
X%E

XDo you know where I could find some nice postcards of The Gnomish Mines?
X%E

XHave you tried the weird toilets?

XDon't stay at the Inn, I hear the food is terrible and it has rats.
X%E
X%Cp T 00009
XThey told me that this was the off season!
X%E
X%Cc T 00010
XIs it really you, %p!  I had given up hope for your return.
XAs you can %x, we are desperately in need of your talents.  Someone must
Xdefeat the %n if our town is become what it once was.
X
XLet me see if you are ready to be that someone.
X%E
X%Cp T 00011
XThings are getting worse, %p.
XI hope that this time you are ready.
X%E
X%Cp T 00012
XI hope that for the sake of %H you have prepared

X%E
X%Cc T 00013
XIt is too late, %p.  You are not even worthy to die amongst us.
XLeave %H and never return.
X%E
X%Cc T 00014
XThere is still too much that you have to learn before you can undertake
Xthe next step.  Return to us as a proven %R, and perhaps then
Xyou will be ready.
X
XGo back now, and may the teachings of %d serve you well.
X%E
X%Cc T 00015
XIt would be an affront to %d to have one not true to the
X%a path undertake her bidding.
X
XYou must not return to us until you have purified yourself of these
Xbad influences on your actions.  Remember, only by following the %a
Xpath can you hope to overcome the obstacles you will face.
X%E
X%Cc T 00016
X%E
XYou have indeed proven yourself a worthy %c, %p.
X
XBut now your kinfolk and I must ask you to put aside your travels and
Xhelp us in our time of need.  After you left us we elected a new mayor,
Xthe %n.  He proved to be a most heinous and vile creature.
X
XSoon after taking office he absconded with %o
Xand fled town, leaving behind his henchmen to rule over us.  In order
Xfor us to regain control of our town, you must enter %i
Xand recover %o.
X
XDo not be distracted on your quest.  If you do not return quickly I fear
Xthat all will be lost.  Let us both pray now that %d will guide you
Xand keep you safe.
X%Cp T 00020
XDo not be fooled by the false promises of the %n.
X%E
X%Cp T 00021
XTo enter %i you must pass many traps.
X%E
X%Cp T 00022
XIf you do not return with %o, your quest
Xwill be in vain.
X%E
X%Cp T 00023
XDo not be afraid to call upon %d if you truly need help.
X%E
X%Cp T 00024
XIf you do not destroy the %n, he will follow you back here!
X%E
X%Cp T 00025
XTake %o from the %n
Xand you may be able to defeat him.
X%E
X%Cp T 00026
XYou must hurry, %p!
X%E
X%Cp T 00027
XYou are like a %S to me, %p.  Do not let me down.
X%E
X%Cp T 00028
XIf you are %a at all times you may succeed, %p.
X%E
X%Cp T 00029
XLet all who meet you on your journey know that you are on an quest for
X%l and grant safe passage.
X%E
X%Cp T 00030
XOnly your faith in %d keeps you from trembling.  You %x
Xthe handiwork of the %n's henchlings everywhere.
X%E
X%Cp T 00031
XYou know that this time you must find and destroy the %n.
X%E
X%Cp T 00040
XYou sense the presence of %o.
X%E
X%Cp T 00041
XYou gain confidence, knowing that you may soon be united with
X%o.
X%E
X%Cc T 00050
XSo, %p, %l thinks that you can wrest
X%o from me!
X
XIt only proves how desperate he has become that he sends a %r to
Xtry and defeat me.  When this day is over, I will have you enslaved
Xin the mines where you will rue the day that you ever entered
X%i.
X%E
X%Cc T 00051
XI let you live the last time because it gave me pleasure.  This time I will
Xdestroy you, %p.
X%E
X%Cp T 00052
XThese meetings come to bore me.  You disturb my workings with
X%o.
X
XIf you do not run away now, I will inflict so much suffering on you that
X%l will feel guilty for ever having sent his %S to me!
X%E
X%Cp T 00053
XYou fool.  You do not know how to call upon the powers of
X%o.
X
XReturn it to me and I will teach you how to use it, and together we
Xwill rule %H.  But do so now, as my patience
Xgrows thin.
X%E
X%Cp T 00060

X%E
X%Cp T 00062

XIf you were not so %a, you might have stood a chance.
X%E

X%E
X%Cp T 00065

X%E
X%Cp T 00066
XWith %o in my possession you can not
Xhope to defeat me.
X%E
X%Cp T 00067
XThe %n has never been defeated, NEVER!
X%E
X%Cp T 00068
XAre you truly the best %H has to send against me?
XI pity %l.
X%E
X%Cp T 00069
XHow do you spell %p?  I want to ensure the marker on your grave is
Xcorrect as a warning to your %sp.
X%E
X%Cc T 00070
XAs you pick up %o, you feel a great
Xweight has been lifted from your shoulders.  Your only thoughts are
Xto quickly return to %H and find %l.
X%E
X%Cc T 00080
XYou turn in the direction of %n.  As his earthly body begins
Xto vanish before your eyes, you hear him curse:
X
X    You shall never be rid of me, %p!
X    I will find you where ever you go and regain what is rightly mine.
X%E
X%Cc T 00081
XAs %l detects the presence of %o,
Xhe almost smiles for the first time in many a full moon.
X
XAs he looks up from %o he says:
X
X    You have recovered %o.  You are its
X    owner now, but not its master.  Let it work with you as you continue
X    your journey.  With its help, and %d to guide you on the
X    %a path, you may yet recover the Amulet of Yendor.
X%E
X%Cc T 00090
XI could not be more proud than if you were my own %S, %p!
XTell me of your adventures in quest of the Amulet of Yendor.
X%E
X%Cc T 00091
XStand back and let me look at you, %p.
XNow that you have recovered the Amulet of Yendor, I'm afraid living
Xout your days in %H would seem pretty tame.
X
XYou have come too far to stop now, for there are still more tasks that

X
XIn places, the snow and ice have been melted into steaming pools of
Xwater.  Fumaroles and pools of bubbling lava surround the hill.
XThe stench of sulphur is carried through the air, and you %x creatures
Xthat should not be able to live in this environment moving towards you.
X%E

XOnce again, you are near the abode of the %l.

X%E
X%Cc V 00010
XAh, %p, my %S.  You have returned to %H
Xat last.  We are in dire need of your aid, but I must determine if you
Xare yet ready for such an undertaking.
X
XLet me read your fate...
X%E
X%Cp V 00011
XLet me read the future for you now, %p, perhaps you have managed to
Xchange it enough...
X%E
X%Cp V 00012
XAgain, I shall read your fate, my %S.  Let us both hope that you have
Xmade changes to become ready for this task...
X%E
X%Cc V 00013
XNo, %p.  Your fate is sealed.  I must cast about for another
Xchampion.  Begone from my presence, and never return.  Know this, that
Xyou shall never succeed in this life, and Valhalla is denied to you.
X%E
X%Cc V 00014
XI see you and %n fighting, %p.  But you are not prepared and
Xshall die at %n's hand if you proceed.  No.  This will not do.
XGo back out into the world, and grow more experienced at the ways of
Xwar.  Only when you have returned a %R will you be able to defeat
X%n.
X%E
X%Cc V 00015
XNO!  This is terrible.  I see you becoming an ally of %n, and
Xleading his armies in the final great battles.  This must not come to
Xpass! You have strayed from the %a path.  You must purge yourself,
Xand return here only when you have regained a state of purity.
X%E
X%Cc V 00016
XIt is not clear, %p, for my sight is limited without
X%o.  But it is now likely that you can defeat %n,
Xand recover %o.
X
XA short time ago, %n and his minions attacked this place.  They
Xopened the huge volcanic vents you %x about the hill, and attacked.
XI knew that this was to come to pass, and had asked %d for a group
Xof %gP to help defend this place.  The few you %x here are the
Xmightiest of Valhalla's own, and are all that are left of one hundred
X%d sent.
X
XDespite the great and glorious battle we fought, %n managed at last
Xto steal %o.  This has upset the balance of the universe, and
Xunless %o is returned into my care, %n may start Ragnarok.
X
XYou must find the entrance to %i.  Travel downward
Xfrom there and you will find %n's lair.  Defeat him and
Xreturn %o to me.
X%E
X%Cp V 00020
XGo with the blessings of %d.
X%E
X%Cp V 00021
XCall upon %d when you are in need.

XUse %o if you can.  It will protect you.
X%E
X%Cp V 00023
XMagical cold is very effective against %n.
X%E
X%Cp V 00024
XTo face %n, you will need to be immune to fire.
X%E
X%Cp V 00025
XMay %d strengthen your sword-arm.
X%E
X%Cp V 00026
XTrust in %d.  He will not desert you.
X%E
X%Cp V 00027
XIt becomes more likely that Ragnarok will come with every passing moment.
XYou must hurry, %p.
X%E
X%Cp V 00028
XIf %n can master %o, he will be powerful enough to
Xface %d far earlier than is fated.  This must not be!
X%E
X%Cp V 00029
XRemember your training, %p.  You can succeed.
X%E
X%Cc V 00030
XThe ice and snow gives way to a valley floor.  You %x ahead of you
Xa huge round hill surrounded by pools of lava.  This then is the entrance
Xto %i.  It looks like you're not going to get in without
Xa fight though.
X%E
X%Cp V 00031
XOnce again, you stand before the entrance to %i.
X%E
X%Cc V 00040
XThrough clouds of sulphurous gasses, you %x a rock palisade
Xsurrounded with a moat of bubbling lava.  You remember the description
Xfrom something that the %l said.  This is the lair of %n.
X%E
X%Cp V 00041
XOnce again, you stand in sight of %n's lair.
X%E
X%Cc V 00050
XSo!  The %l has finally sent a %c to challenge me!
X
XI thought that mastering %o would enable me to challenge %d,
Xbut it has shown me that first I must kill you!
XSo come, little %s.  Once I defeat you, I can at last begin
Xthe final battle with %d.
X%E
X%Cp V 00051
XAgain you challenge me, %r.  Good.  I will kill you now.
X%E
X%Cp V 00052
XHave you not learned yet?  You cannot defeat %n!
X%E
X%Cp V 00053
XI will kill you, %c, and wrest %o from your mangled hands.
X%E
X%Cp V 00060
XI am your death, %c.
X%E
X%Cp V 00061
XYou cannot prevail, %r.  I have foreseen your every move.
X%E
X%Cp V 00062
XWith you out of the way, Valhalla will be mine for the taking.
X%E
X%Cp V 00063
XI killed scores of %d's best when I took %o.
XDo you really think that one %c can stand against me?
X%E
X%Cp V 00064
XWho bears the souls of %cP to Valhalla, %r?
X%E
X%Cp V 00065
XNo, %d cannot help you here.
X%E
X%Cp V 00066
XSome instrument of %d you are, %p.  You are a weakling!
X%E
X%Cp V 00067
XNever have I seen a %c so clumsy in battle.
X%E
X%Cp V 00068
XYou die now, little %s.
X%E
X%Cp V 00069
XYour body I destroy now, your soul when my hordes overrun Valhalla!
X%E
X%Cc V 00070
XAs you pick up %o, your mind is suddenly filled with images,
Xand you perceive all of the possibilities of each potential choice you
Xcould make.  As you begin to control and channel your thoughts, you
Xrealize that you must return %o to the %l immediately.
X%E
X%Cc V 00080
XSuddenly a look of surprise and horror appear on %n's face.
X
X    No!!!  %o has lied to me!  I have been misled!
X
XSuddenly, %n grasps his head and screams in agony, then dies.
X%E
X%Cc V 00081
XAs you approach, the %l rises and touches %o.
X
XYou may take %o with you, %p.  I have removed from
Xit the power to foretell the future, for that power no mortal should
Xhave.  Its other abilities, however, you have at your disposal.
X
XYou must now begin in %d's name to search for the Amulet of Yendor.
XMay your steps be guided by %d, my %S.
X%E
X%Cp V 00090
XGreetings, %p.  I have not been able to pay as much attention to
Xyour search for the Amulet as I have wished.  How do you fare?
X%E
X%Cc V 00091
XExcellent, %p.  I see you have recovered the Amulet!
X
XYou must take the Amulet to the Great Temple of %d, on the Astral
Xplane.  There you must offer the Amulet to %d.

XAmulet interferes with mine.  I hope for your success.

XHowever, things are not the same as when you were last here.  Mists and

X%Cc W 00010
XCome closer, %p, for my voice falters in my old age.
XYes, I see that you have come a long way since you went out into the

Xdetermine if you have all of the skills required to take on the task
XI require of you.
X%E
X%Cp W 00011
XWell, %p, you have returned.  Perhaps you are now ready...
X%E

X%E
X%Cc W 00014
XAlas, %p, you have not yet shown your proficiency as a worthy

Xahead.  Go, now, expand your horizons, and return when you have attained
Xrenown as a %R.
X%E
X%Cc W 00015
XYou amaze me, %p!  How many times did I tell you that Balance
Xrequires care.  One must use the world with care, lest one leave it in ruins
Xand simplify the task of the %n.
X
XYou must go back and show your worthiness.  Do not return until you are
Xtruly ready for this quest.  May %d guide you in this task.
X%E
X%Cc W 00016
X%E
XYes, %p, you truly are ready for this dire task.  Listen,
Xcarefully, for what I tell you now will be of vital importance.
X
XSince you left us to hone your skills in the world, we unexpectedly came
Xunder attack by the forces of the %n.  As you know, we thought
Xthe %n had perished at the end of the last age, but, alas, this was
Xnot the case.
X
XThe %n sent an army of abominations against us.  Among them was a
Xminion, mindless and ensorcelled, and thus, in the confusion, it was able
Xto penetrate our defenses.  Alas, this creature has stolen
X%o and I fear it has delivered %o
Xto the %n.
X
XOver the years, I had woven most of my power into this amulet, and thus,
Xwithout it, I have but a shadow of my former power, and I fear that I
Xshall soon perish.
X
XYou must travel to %i, and within its dungeons,
Xfind and overcome the %n, and return %o to me.
X
XGo now, with %d, and return Balance to the world.
X%Cp W 00020
XBeware, for the %n is immune to most magical attacks.
X%E
X%Cp W 00021
XTo enter %i you must pass many traps.
X%E
X%Cp W 00022
XThe %n may be vulnerable to physical attacks.
X%E
X%Cp W 00023
X%d will come to your aid when you call.
X%E
X%Cp W 00024
XYou must utterly destroy the %n.  He will pursue you otherwise.
X%E

XYou believe that you may once again invade %i.
X%E
X%Cp W 00040

X%o from me, hmmm?  Well, the %l is a

XYour destruction, however, should make for good sport.  In the end, you
Xshall beg me to kill you!
X%E

XAs you touch %o, its comforting power infuses you

X
X    Take %o with you in your quest for

X
X    May %d guide you in your quest, and keep you from harm.

XCome near, my %S, and share your adventures with me.  So, have you
Xsucceeded in your quest for the Amulet of Yendor?
X%E
X%Cc W 00091
XCongratulations, %p.  I always knew that if anyone could succeed
Xin defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.
X
XGo now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
Xthe Amulet on the altar of %d.  Along the way you shall pass through the
Xfour elemental planes.  These planes are like nothing you have ever
Xexperienced before, so be prepared!
X
XFor this you were born, %s!  I am very proud of you.

XIt is written in the Book of %d:
X
X    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
X    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
X    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
X    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
X    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
X    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.
X
XYour god %d seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
Xto gain his deserved ascendance over the other gods.
X
XYou, a newly trained %r, have been heralded
Xfrom birth as the instrument of %d.  You are destined
Xto recover the Amulet for your deity, or die in the
Xattempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For the sake
Xof us all:  Go bravely with %d!
X%E
