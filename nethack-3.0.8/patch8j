X
X*** 1.  Introduction
X
X    You  have just finished your years as a student at the local adventurer's
Xguild.  After much  practice  and  sweat  you  have  finally  completed  your
Xtraining  and  are  ready to embark upon a perilous adventure.  To prove your
Xworthiness, the local guildmasters have sent you into the  Mazes  of  Menace.
XYour  quest is to return with the Amulet of Yendor.  According to legend, the
Xgods will grant immortality to the one who recovers this  artifact;  true  or
Xnot,  its recovery will bring honor and full guild membership (not to mention
Xthe attentions of certain wealthy wizards).
X
X    Your abilities and strengths for dealing with the  hazards  of  adventure
Xwill vary with your background and training:
X
XArcheologists
X        understand dungeons pretty well; this enables them  to  move  quickly
X        and  sneak  up  on  dungeon nasties.  They start equipped with proper
X        tools for a scientific expedition.
X
XBarbarians
X        are  warriors  out of the hinterland, hardened to battle.  They begin
X        their quests with naught but uncommon strength, a trusty hauberk, and
X        a great two-handed sword.
X
XCavemen and Cavewomen
X        start with exceptional strength and neolithic weapons.
X
XElves
X        are  agile,  quick,  and  sensitive; very little of what goes on will
X        escape an Elf.  The quality of Elven craftsmanship often  gives  them
X        an advantage in arms and armor.
X
XHealers
X        are wise in medicine and the apothecary.  They  know  the  herbs  and
X        simples  that  can  restore  vitality,  ease  pain,  anesthetize, and
X        neutralize poisons; and with their instruments,  they  can  divine  a
X        being's  state  of  health or sickness.  Their medical practice earns
X        them quite reasonable amounts of money, which they enter the  dungeon
X        with.
X
XKnights
X        are distinguished from the common skirmisher by their devotion to the
X        ideals of chivalry and by the surpassing excellence of their armor.
X
XPriests and Priestesses
X        are clerics militant, crusaders advancing the cause of  righteousness
X        with  arms,  armor,  and arts thaumaturgic.  Their ability to commune
X        with deities via prayer occasionally extricates them from peril,  but
X        can also put them in it.
X
XRogues
X        are agile and stealthy thieves, who carry daggers,  lock  picks,  and
X        poisons to put on darts.
X
XSamurai
X        are the elite warriors of feudal Nippon.  They  are  lightly  armored
X        and  quick,  and  wear  the  dai-sho,  two  swords  of  the deadliest
X        keenness.
X
XTourists
X        start  out  with  lots of gold (suitable for shopping with), a credit
X        card, lots of food,  some  maps,  and  an  expensive  camera.    Most
X        monsters don't like being photographed.
X
XValkyries
X        are hardy warrior women.  Their upbringing in  the  harsh  Northlands
X        makes  them  strong and inures them to extremes of cold, and instills
X        in them stealth and cunning.
X
XWizards
X        start  out  with a fair selection of magical goodies and a particular
X        affinity for dweomercraft.
X
X    You set out for the dungeon and after several days of uneventful  travel,
Xyou  see the ancient ruins that mark the entrance to the Mazes of Menace.  It
Xis late at night, so you make camp  at  the  entrance  and  spend  the  night
Xsleeping  under  the  open  skies.  In the morning, you gather your gear, eat
Xwhat may be your last meal outside, and enter the dungeon.
X
X*** 2.  What is going on here?
X
X    You have just begun a game of NetHack.  Your goal  is  to  grab  as  much
Xtreasure  as  you can, retrieve the Amulet of Yendor, and escape the Mazes of
XMenace alive.  On the screen is kept a map of where you have  been  and  what
Xyou have seen on the current dungeon level; as you explore more of the level,
Xit appears on the screen in front of you.
X
X    When NetHack's ancestor rogue first appeared, its screen orientation  was
Xalmost  unique  among computer fantasy games.  Since then, screen orientation
Xhas become the norm rather than the exception; NetHack  continues  this  fine
Xtradition.  Unlike text adventure games that input commands in pseudo-English
Xsentences and explain the results in words, NetHack commands are all  one  or
Xtwo  keystrokes  and  the results are displayed graphically on the screen.  A
Xminimum screen size of 24 lines by 80 columns is recommended; if  the  screen
Xis larger, only a 21x80 section will be used for the map.
X
X    NetHack  generates a new dungeon every time you play it; even the authors
Xstill find it an entertaining and exciting game despite  having  won  several
Xtimes.
X
X*** 3.  What do all those things on the screen mean?
X
X    In  order  to  understand  what  is  going  on in NetHack, first you must
Xunderstand what NetHack is  doing  with  the  screen.    The  NetHack  screen
Xreplaces  the  ``You see...'' descriptions of text adventure games.  Figure 1
Xis a sample of what a NetHack screen might look like.

X
X*** 3.1.  The status lines (bottom)
X
X    The bottom two lines of the screen  contain  several  cryptic  pieces  of
Xinformation  describing  your  current status.  If either status line becomes
Xlonger than the width of the screen, you might not see all of it.   Here  are
Xexplanations of what the various status items mean (though your configuration
Xmay not have all the status items listed below):
X
XRank
X        Your   character's  name  and  professional  ranking  (based  on  the
X        experience level, see below).
X
XStrength
X        A  measure  of  your  character's  strength,  one  of  your six basic
X        attributes.  Your  attributes  can  range  from  3  to  18  inclusive
X        (occasionally  you  may  get super-strengths of the form 18/xx).  The
X        higher your strength, the stronger you are.    Strength  affects  how
X        successfully you perform physical tasks and how much damage you do in
X        combat.
X
XDexterity
X        affects  your  chances to hit in combat, to avoid traps, and do other
X        tasks requiring agility or manipulation of objects.
X
XConstitution
X        affects  your  ability  to withstand injury and other strains on your
X        stamina.
X
XIntelligence
X        affects your ability to cast spells.
X
XWisdom
X        comes from your religious affairs.  It affects your magical energy.
X
XCharisma
X        affects  how  certain  creatures react toward you.  In particular, it
X        can affect the prices shopkeepers offer you.
X
XAlignment
X        Lawful,  Neutral,  or Chaotic.  Basically, Lawful is good and Chaotic
X        is evil.  Your alignment influences how other monsters  react  toward
X        you.
X
XDungeon Level
X        How deep you have gone into the  dungeon.    It  starts  at  one  and
X        increases as you go deeper into the dungeon.  The Amulet of Yendor is
X        reputed to be somewhere beneath the twentieth level.
X
XGold
X        The number of gold pieces you have.
X
XHit Points
X        Your current and maximum hit points.  Hit points  indicate  how  much
X        damage you can take before you die.  The more you get hit in a fight,
X        the lower they get.  You can regain  hit  points  by  resting.    The
X        number  in  parentheses  is  the  maximum  number your hit points can
X        reach.
X
XPower
X        Spell  points.  This tells you how much mystic energy (mana) you have
X        available for spell casting.  When you type `+' to list your  spells,
X        each will have a spell point cost beside it in parentheses.  You will
X        not see this if your dungeon has been set up without spells.
X
XArmor Class
X        A  measure  of how effectively your armor stops blows from unfriendly
X        creatures.  The lower this number is, the more effective  the  armor;
X        it is quite possible to have negative armor class.
X
XExperience
X        Your  current  experience  level  and  experience  points.    As  you
X        adventure,  you  gain experience points.  At certain experience point
X        totals, you gain an experience level.  The more experienced you  are,
X        the  better  you  fight and withstand magical attacks.  Many dungeons
X        show only your experience level here.
X
XTime
X        The  number  of  turns elapsed so far, displayed if you have the time
X        option set.
X
XHunger Status
X        Your  current  hunger status, ranging from Satiated down to Fainting.
X        If your hunger status is normal, it is not displayed.
X
X    Additional status flags may appear after the hunger status:    Conf  when
Xyou're confused, Sick when sick, Blind when you can't see, Stun when stunned,
Xand Hallu when hallucinating.
X
X*** 3.2.  The message line (top)
X
X    The top line of the screen is reserved for messages that describe  things
Xthat  are impossible to represent visually.  If you see a ``--More--'' on the
Xtop line, this means that NetHack has  another  message  to  display  on  the
Xscreen,  but  it wants to make certain that you've read the one that is there
Xfirst.  To read the next message, just press the space bar.
X
X*** 3.3.  The map (rest of the screen)
X
X    The rest of the screen is the map of the level as you have explored it so
Xfar.    Each  symbol  on  the  screen  represents something.  You can set the
Xgraphics option to change some of the symbols the game uses;  otherwise,  the
Xgame  will  use  default symbols.  Here is a list of what the default symbols
Xmean:
X
X- and | The walls of a room, or an open door.
X
X.       The floor of a room, or a doorless doorway.
X
X#       A corridor, or possibly a kitchen sink or drawbridge (if your dungeon
X        has sinks or drawbridges).
X
X<       A way to the previous level.
X
X>       A way to the next level.
X
X+       A  closed  door, or a spell book containing a spell you can learn (if
X        your dungeon has spell books).
X
X@       A human (you, usually).
X
X$       A pile of gold.
X
X^       A trap (once you detect it).
X
X)       A weapon.
X
X[       A suit or piece of armor.
X
X%       A piece of food (not necessarily healthy).
X
X?       A scroll.
X
X/       A wand.
X
X=       A ring.
X
X!       A potion.
X
X(       A useful item (pick-axe, key, lamp...).
X
X"       An amulet, or a spider web.
X
X*       A gem or rock (possibly valuable, possibly worthless).
X
X`       A boulder or statue.
X
X0       An iron ball.
X
X_       An altar (if your dungeon has altars), or an iron chain.
X
X}       A pool of water or moat.
X
X{       A fountain (your dungeon may not have fountains).
X
X\       An opulent throne (your dungeon may not have thrones either).
X
Xa-zA-Z  and other symbols.  Letters and certain other symbols  represent  the
X        various  inhabitants  of the Mazes of Menace.  Watch out, they can be
X        nasty and vicious.  Sometimes, however, they can be helpful.
X
X    You need not memorize all these symbols; you can ask the  game  what  any
Xsymbol  represents  with  the  `/' command (see the Commands section for more
Xinfo).
X
X*** 4.  Commands
X
X    Commands are given to NetHack by typing one or  two  characters;  NetHack
Xthen asks questions to find out what it needs to know to do your bidding.
X
X    For  example,  a  common question, in the form ``What do you want to use?
X[a-zA-Z ?*]'', asks you  to  choose  an  object  you  are  carrying.    Here,
X``a-zA-Z''  are  the  inventory letters of your possible choices.  Typing `?'
Xgives you an inventory list of these items, so you can see what  each  letter
Xrefers  to.    In  this  example, there is also a `*' indicating that you may
Xchoose an object not on the list, if you wanted to use something  unexpected.
XTyping  a  `*'  lists  your  entire  inventory,  so you can see the inventory
Xletters of every object you're carrying.  Finally, if you  change  your  mind
Xand decide you don't want to do this command after all, you can press the ESC
Xkey to abort the command.
X
X    You can put a number before most commands to repeat them that many times;
Xfor  example,  ``10s''  will  search  ten  times.  If you have the number_pad
Xoption set, you must type `n' to prefix a count, so the example  above  would
Xbe  typed  ``n10s''  instead.  Commands for which counts make no sense ignore
Xthem.  In addition, movement commands can be  prefixed  for  greater  control
X(see below).  To cancel a count or a prefix, press the ESC key.
X
X    The  list  of  commands  is  rather  long, but it can be read at any time
Xduring the game through the `?' command, which accesses  a  menu  of  helpful
Xtexts.  Here are the commands for your reference:
X
X?       Help menu:  display one of several help texts available.
X
X/       Tell  what a symbol represents.  You may choose to specify a location
X        or type a symbol (or even a whole word)  to  define.    If  the  help
X        option  is  on,  and  NetHack  has  some special information about an
X        object or monster that you looked at, you'll be  asked  if  you  want
X        ``More  info?''.    If  help is off, then you'll only get the special
X        information if you explicitly ask for it by typing in the name of the
X        monster or object.
X
X&       Tell what a command does.
X
X<       Go up a staircase to the previous level (if you are on the stairs).
X
X>       Go down a staircase to the next level (if you are on the stairs).
X
X[yuhjklbn]
X        Go one step in the direction indicated (see Figure 2).  If there is a
X        monster  there,  you  will  fight  the  monster  instead.  Only these
X        one-step movement commands cause you to fight  monsters;  the  others
X        (below) are ``safe.''

X
X[YUHJKLBN]
X        Go in that direction until you hit a wall or run into something.
X
Xm[yuhjklbn]
X        Prefix:  move without picking up any objects.
X
XM[yuhjklbn]
X        Prefix:  move far, no pickup.
X
Xg[yuhjklbn]
X        Prefix:  move until something interesting is found.
X
XG[yuhjklbn]
X        Prefix:  same as `g', but forking  of  corridors  is  not  considered
X        interesting.
X
X.       Rest, do nothing for one turn.
X
Xa       Apply (use) a tool (pick-axe, key, lamp...).
X
XA       Remove  all  armor.  Use `T' (take off) to take off only one piece of
X        armor.
X
X^A      Redo the previous command.
X
Xc       Close a door.
X
XC       Call (name) an individual monster.
X
X^C      Panic button.  Quit the game.
X
Xd       Drop something.  Ex. ``d7a'' means drop seven items of object a.
X
XD       Drop several things.  In answer  to  the  question  ``What  kinds  of
X        things  do  you want to drop? [!%= au]'' you should type zero or more
X        object symbols possibly followed by `a' and/or `u'.
X
X        Da - drop all objects, without asking for confirmation.
X        Du - drop only unpaid objects (when in a shop).
X        D%u - drop only unpaid food.
X
X^D      Kick something (usually a door).
X
Xe       Eat food.
X
XE       Engrave a message on the floor.  Engraving the word ``Elbereth'' will
X        cause  most  monsters  to  not  attack  you  hand-to-hand (but if you
X        attack, you will rub it out); this is often useful to give yourself a
X        breather.    (This  feature  may be compiled out of the game, so your
X        version might not necessarily have it.)
X
X        E- - write in the dust with your fingers.
X
Xi       List your inventory (everything you're carrying).
X
XI       List selected parts of your inventory.
X
X        I* - list all gems in inventory;
X        Iu - list all unpaid items;
X        Ix - list all used up items that are on your shopping bill;
X        I$ - count your money.
X
Xo       Open a door.
X
XO       Set  options.    You  will  be asked to enter an option line.  If you
X        enter a blank line, the current options are reported.   Entering  `?'
X        will  get  you  explanations  of the various options.  Otherwise, you
X        should enter a list of options separated by commas.    The  available
X        options  are listed later in this Guidebook.  Options are usually set
X        before the game, not with the `O' command; see the section on options
X        below.
X
Xp       Pay your shopping bill.
X
XP       Put on a ring.
X
X^P      Repeat previous message (subsequent ^P's repeat earlier messages).
X
Xq       uaff (drink) a potion.
X
XQ       Quit the game.

X        may  obtain  a  list of them by entering `?'.  What extended commands
X        are available depend on what features the game was compiled with.
X
X        If your keyboard has a meta key (which, when pressed  in  combination
X        with  another key, modifies it by setting the `meta' [8th, or `high']
X        bit), you can invoke the extended  commands  by  meta-ing  the  first
X        letter  of  the  command.  In PC and ST NetHack, the `Alt' key can be
X        used in this fashion.
X
XM-a     Adjust inventory letters (the fixinvlet option must be ``on''  to  do
X        this).
X
XM-c     Talk to someone.
X
XM-d     Dip an object into something.
X
XM-f     Force a lock.
X
XM-j     Jump to another location.
X
XM-l     Loot a box on the floor.
X
XM-m     Use a monster's special ability.
X
XM-N     Name an item or type of object.
X
XM-o     Offer a sacrifice to the gods.
X
XM-p     Pray to the gods for help.
X
XM-r     Rub a lamp.
X
XM-s     Sit down.
X
XM-t     Turn undead.
X
XM-u     Untrap something (usually a trapped object).
X
XM-v     Print compile time options for this version of NetHack.
X
XM-w     Wipe off your face.
X
X    If the number_pad option is on, additional letter commands are available:
X
Xj       Jump to another location.  Same as ``#jump'' or ``M-j''.
X
Xk       Kick something (usually a door).  Same as `^D'.
X
Xl       Loot a box on the floor.  Same as ``#loot'' or ``M-l''.
X
XN       Name an item or type of object.  Same as ``#name'' or ``M-N''.
X
Xu       Untrap a trapped object or door.  Same as ``#untrap'' or ``M-u''.
X
X*** 5.  Rooms and corridors
X
X    Rooms  in  the  dungeon  are  either lit or dark.  If you walk into a lit
Xroom, the entire room will be drawn on the screen.  If you walk into  a  dark
Xroom,  only  the  areas  you can see will be displayed.  In darkness, you can
Xonly see one space in all directions.  Corridors are always dark, but  remain
Xon the map as you explore them.
X
X    Secret  corridors  are  hidden.   You can find them with the `s' (search)
Xcommand.
X
X*** 5.1.  Doorways
X
X    Doorways connect rooms and corridors.  Some doorways have no  doors;  you
Xcan  walk  right  through.    Others  have  doors in them, which may be open,
Xclosed, or locked.  To open a closed door, use the  `o'  (open)  command;  to
Xclose it again, use the `c' (close) command.
X
X    You  can  get through a locked door by using a tool to pick the lock with
Xthe `a' (apply) command, or by kicking it open with the `^D' (kick) command.
X
X    Open doors cannot be entered diagonally; you must approach them  straight
Xon, horizontally or vertically.  Doorways without doors are not restricted.
X
X    Doors can be useful for shutting out monsters.  Most monsters cannot open
Xdoors, although a few don't need to (ex. ghosts can walk through doors).
X
X    Secret doors are hidden.   You  can  find  them  with  the  `s'  (search)
Xcommand.
X
X*** 5.2.  Traps (`^')
X
X    There  are  traps throughout the dungeon to snare the unwary delver.  For
Xexample, you may suddenly fall into a pit and  be  stuck  for  a  few  turns.
XTraps  don't  appear  on your map until you trigger one by moving onto it, or
Xyou discover it with the `s' (search) command.  Monsters  can  fall  prey  to
Xtraps, too.
X
X*** 6.  Monsters
X    Monsters  you  cannot  see are not displayed on the screen.  Beware!  You
Xmay suddenly come upon one in a dark place.  Some magic items  can  help  you
Xlocate them before they locate you, which some monsters do very well.
X
X*** 6.1.  Fighting
X
X    If  you see a monster and you wish to fight it, just attempt to walk into
Xit.  Many monsters you find will mind their own business  unless  you  attack
Xthem.    Some of them are very dangerous when angered.  Remember:  Discretion
Xis the better part of valor.
X
X*** 6.2.  Your pet
X
X    You start the game with a little dog (`d') or cat  (`f'),  which  follows
Xyou about the dungeon and fights monsters with you.  Like you, your pet needs
Xfood to survive.  It usually feeds itself on fresh carrion and  other  meats.
XIf  you're  worried  about  it  or want to train it, you can feed it, too, by
Xthrowing it food.
X
X    Your pet also gains experience from killing monsters, and can  grow  over
Xtime, gaining hit points and doing more damage.  Initially, your pet may even
Xbe better at killing things than you, which makes pets useful  for  low-level
Xcharacters.
X
X    Your  pet  will  follow  you up and down staircases, if it is next to you
Xwhen you move.  Otherwise, your pet will be stranded, and may become wild.
X
X*** 6.3.  Ghost levels
X
X    You may encounter the shades and corpses of other  adventurers  (or  even
Xformer  incarnations  of  yourself!)  and their personal effects.  Ghosts are
Xhard to kill, but easy to avoid, since they're slow  and  do  little  damage.
XYou  can  plunder  the  deceased  adventurer's possessions; however, they are
Xlikely to be cursed.  Beware of whatever killed the former player.
X
X*** 7.  Objects
X
X    When you find something in the dungeon, it is common to want to  pick  it
Xup.    In  NetHack,  this  is  accomplished automatically by walking over the
Xobject (unless you turn off the pickup option (see below), or move  with  the
X`m'  prefix  (see  above)),  or manually by using the `,' command.  If you're
Xcarrying too many things, NetHack will tell you so and won't pick up anything
Xmore.    Otherwise,  it will add the object(s) to your pack and tell you what
Xyou just picked up.
X
X    When you pick up an object, it is assigned an  inventory  letter.    Many
Xcommands  that  operate  on objects must ask you to find out which object you
Xwant to use.  When NetHack asks you to choose a  particular  object  you  are
Xcarrying,  you  are  usually  presented  with  a list of inventory letters to
Xchoose from (see Commands, above).
X
X    Some objects, such as weapons, are easily differentiated.   Others,  like
Xscrolls  and  potions,  are  given descriptions which vary according to type.
XDuring a game, any two objects with the same description are the  same  type.
XHowever, the descriptions will vary from game to game.
X
X    When you use one of these objects, if its effect is obvious, NetHack will
Xremember what it is for you.  If its effect isn't extremely obvious, you will
Xbe  asked  what you want to call this type of object so you will recognize it
Xlater.  You can also use the ``#name'' command for the same  purpose  at  any
Xtime, to name all objects of a particular type or just an individual object.
X
X*** 7.1.  Curses and blessings
X
X    Any  object  that you find may be cursed, even if the object is otherwise
Xhelpful.  The most common effect of a curse is being stuck with (and to)  the
Xitem.    Cursed  weapons  weld  themselves  to your hand when wielded, so you
Xcannot unwield them.  Any cursed item you wear is not removable  by  ordinary
Xmeans.    In  addition,  cursed  arms and armor usually, but not always, bear
Xnegative enchantments that make them less effective in combat.  Other  cursed
Xobjects may act poorly or detrimentally in other ways.
X
X    Objects  can  also  become blessed.  Blessed items usually work better or
Xmore beneficially than normal uncursed items.  For example, a blessed  weapon
Xwill do more damage against demons.
X
X    There  are magical means of bestowing or removing curses upon objects, so
Xeven if you are stuck with one, you can still have the curse lifted  and  the
Xitem  removed.   Priests and Priestesses have an innate sensitivity to curses
Xand blessings, so they can  more  easily  avoid  cursed  objects  than  other
Xcharacter classes.
X
X    An  item  with  unknown  curse  status,  and an item which you know to be
Xuncursed, will be distinguished in your inventory by the presence of the word
X``uncursed''  in  the  description  of  the latter.  The exception is if this
Xdescription isn't needed; you can look at the inventory description and  know
Xthat  you  have  discovered whether it's cursed.  This applies to items which
Xhave ``plusses,'' and items with charges.
X
X*** 7.2.  Weapons (`)')
X
X    Given a  chance,  almost  all  monsters  in  the  Mazes  of  Menace  will
Xgratuitously  kill  you.    You  need  weapons for self-defense (killing them
Xfirst).  Without a weapon, you  do  only  1-2  hit  points  of  damage  (plus
Xbonuses, if any).
X
X    There  are  wielded  weapons,  like maces and swords, and thrown weapons,
Xlike arrows.  To hit monsters with a weapon, you must  wield  it  and  attack
Xthem,  or  throw  it at them.  To shoot an arrow out of a bow, you must first
Xwield the bow, then throw the arrow.  Crossbows shoot crossbow bolts.  Slings
Xhurl  rocks  and  (other) gems.  You can wield only one weapon at a time, but
Xyou can change weapons unless you're wielding a cursed one.
X
X    Enchanted weapons have a ``plus'' (which can also be a minus)  that  adds
Xto  your  chance  to hit and the damage you do to a monster.  The only way to
Xfind out if a weapon is enchanted is to have it magically identified somehow.
X
X    Those of you in the audience who are AD&D players,  be  aware  that  each
Xweapon  which  exists  in  AD&D  does the same damage to monsters in NetHack.
XSome of the more obscure weapons (such  as  the  aklys,  lucern  hammer,  and
Xbec-de-corbin)  are  defined  in  an  appendix  to  Unearthed Arcana, an AD&D
Xsupplement.
X
X    The commands to use weapons are `w' (wield) and `t' (throw).
X
X*** 7.3.  Armor (`[')
X
X    Lots of unfriendly things lurk about; you need armor to protect  yourself
Xfrom  their  blows.  Some types of armor offer better protection than others.
XYour armor class is a measure of  this  protection.    Armor  class  (AC)  is
Xmeasured  as  in  AD&D,  with  10 being the equivalent of no armor, and lower
Xnumbers meaning better armor.  Each suit of armor which exists in AD&D  gives
Xthe  same  protection  in NetHack.  Here is an (incomplete) list of the armor
Xclasses provided by various suits of armor:
X    dragon scale mail       1
X    plate mail              3
X    bronze plate mail       4
X    splint mail             4
X    banded mail             4
X    elven mithril-coat      5
X    chain mail              5
X    scale mail              6
X    ring mail               7
X    studded leather armor   7
X    leather armor           8
X    no armor                10
X
X    You can also wear other pieces of armor  (ex.  helmets,  boots,  shields,
Xcloaks)  to  lower  your  armor class even further, but you can only wear one
Xitem of each category (one suit of armor, one cloak, one helmet, one  shield,
Xand so on).
X
X    If a piece of armor is enchanted, its armor protection will be better (or
Xworse) than normal, and its ``plus'' (or minus) will subtract from your armor
Xclass.    For  example, a +1 chain mail would give you better protection than
Xnormal chain mail, lowering your armor class one unit further to 4.  When you
Xput  on  a  piece  of armor, you immediately find out the armor class and any
X``plusses'' it provides.   Cursed  pieces  of  armor  usually  have  negative
Xenchantments (minuses) in addition to being unremovable.
X
X    The commands to use armor are `W' (wear) and `T' (take off).
X
X*** 7.4.  Food (`%')
X
X    Food is necessary to survive.  If you go too long without eating you will
Xfaint, and eventually die of starvation.   Unprotected  food  does  not  stay
Xfresh  indefinitely;  after  a  while it will spoil, and be unhealthy to eat.
XFood stored in ice boxes or tins (``cans'' to  you  Americans)  will  usually
Xstay fresh, but ice boxes are heavy, and tins take a while to open.
X
X    When  you  kill  monsters,  they  usually  leave  corpses  which are also
X``food.''  Many, but not all, of these are edible; some also give you special
Xpowers when you eat them.  A good rule of thumb is ``you are what you eat.''
X
X    You can name one food item after something you like to eat with the fruit
Xoption, if your dungeon has it.
X
X    The command to eat food is `e'.
X
X*** 7.5.  Scrolls (`?')
X
X    Scrolls are labeled with  various  titles,  probably  chosen  by  ancient
Xwizards  for  their  amusement  value  (ex.  ``READ  ME,''  or ``HOLY BIBLE''
Xbackwards).  Scrolls disappear after you read them (except  for  blank  ones,
Xwithout magic spells on them).
X
X    One  of  the most useful of these is the scroll of identify, which can be
Xused to determine what another object is, whether it is  cursed  or  blessed,
Xand  how  many  uses  it  has  left.   Some objects of subtle enchantment are
Xdifficult to identify without these.
X
X    If you receive mail while you are playing (on versions compiled with this
Xfeature), a mail daemon may run up and deliver it to you as a scroll of mail.
XTo use this feature, you must let NetHack know where to look for new mail  by
Xsetting  the  ``MAIL'' environment variable to the file name of your mailbox.
XYou may also want to set the ``MAILREADER'' environment variable to the  file
Xname  of  your  favorite reader, so NetHack can shell to it when you read the
Xscroll.
X
X    The command to read a scroll is `r'.
X
X*** 7.6.  Potions (`!')
X
X    Potions are distinguished by the color of the liquid  inside  the  flask.
XThey disappear after you quaff them.
X
X    Clear  potions  are  potions  of  water.   Sometimes these are blessed or
Xcursed, resulting in holy or unholy water.  Holy water is  the  bane  of  the
Xundead,  so  potions of holy water are good thing to throw (`t') at them.  It
Xalso is very useful when you dip (``#dip'') other objects in it.
X
X    The command to drink a potion is `q' (quaff).
X
X*** 7.7.  Wands (`/')
X
X    Magic wands have multiple magical charges.  Some wands  are  directional,
Xyou  must give a direction to zap them in.  You can also zap them at yourself
X(just give a `.'  or `s' for the direction), but it is often unwise.    Other
Xwands  are  nondirectional,  they  don't  ask  for directions.  The number of
Xcharges in a wand is random, and decreases by one whenever you use it.
X
X    The command to use a wand is `z' (zap).
X
X*** 7.8.  Rings (`=')
X
X    Rings are very useful items, since they are relatively  permanent  magic,
Xunlike the usually fleeting effects of potions, scrolls, and wands.
X
X    Putting  on a ring activates its magic.  You can wear only two rings, one
Xon each ring finger.
X
X    Most rings also cause you to grow hungry more rapidly, the  rate  varying
Xwith the type of ring.
X
X    The commands to use rings are `P' (put on) and `R' (remove).
X
X*** 7.9.  Spell books (`+')
X
X    Spell  books are tomes of mighty magic.  When studied with the `r' (read)
Xcommand, they bestow the knowledge of a spell, unless the attempt  backfires.
XReading  a cursed spell book, or one with mystic runes beyond your ken can be
Xharmful to your health!
X
X    A spell can also backfire when you cast it.  If you  attempt  to  cast  a
Xspell  well  above your experience level, or cast it at a time when your luck
Xis particularly bad, you can end up wasting both  the  energy  and  the  time
Xrequired in casting.
X
X    Casting  a  spell calls forth magical energies and focuses them with your
Xnaked mind.  Releasing the magical energy releases some of your memory of the
Xspell  with  it.    Each time you cast a spell, your familiarity with it will
Xdwindle, until you eventually forget the details completely and must  relearn
Xit.
X
X    The  command to read a spell book is the same as for scrolls, `r' (read).
XThe `+' command lists your current spells and the number of spell points they
Xrequire.  The `Z' (cast) command casts a spell.
X
X*** 7.10.  Tools (`(')
X
X    Tools  are  miscellaneous  objects with various purposes.  Some tools are
Xlike wands in that they have a limited number of uses.   For  example,  lamps
Xburn  out  after  a  while.  Other tools are containers, which objects can be
Xplaced into or taken out of.
X
X    The command to use tools is `a' (apply).
X
X*** 7.10.1.  Chests and boxes
X
X    You may encounter chests or boxes in your travels.  These can  be  opened
Xwith  the  ``#loot'' extended command when they are on the floor, or with the
X`a' (apply) command when you are carrying one.   However,  chests  are  often
Xlocked,  and require you to either use a key to unlock it, a tool to pick the
Xlock, or to break it open with brute force.  Chests are unwieldy objects, and
Xmust be set down to be unlocked (by kicking them, using a key or lock picking
Xtool with the `a' (apply) command, or by using a weapon  to  force  the  lock
Xwith the ``#force'' extended command).
X
X    Some  chests  are trapped, causing nasty things to happen when you unlock
Xor open them.  You can check  for  and  try  to  deactivate  traps  with  the
X``#untrap'' extended command.
X
X*** 7.11.  Amulets (`"')
X
X    Amulets  are very similar to rings, and often more powerful.  Like rings,
Xamulets have various magical properties, some beneficial, some harmful, which
Xare activated by putting them on.
X
X    The  commands  to use amulets are the same as for rings, `P' (put on) and
X`R' (remove).
X
X*** 7.12.  Gems (`*')
X
X    Some gems are valuable, and can  be  sold  for  a  lot  of  gold  pieces.
XValuable  gems  increase your score if you bring them with you when you exit.
XOther small rocks are also categorized  as  gems,  but  they  are  much  less
Xvaluable.
X
X*** 7.13.  Large rocks (``')
X
X    Statues  and  boulders  are  not  particularly  useful, and are generally
Xheavy.  It is rumored that some statues are not what they seem.
X
X*** 7.14.  Gold (`$')
X
X    Gold adds to your score, and you can buy things in shops with it.    Your
Xversion of NetHack may display how much gold you have on the status line.  If
Xnot, the `$' command will count it.
X
X*** 8.  Options
X
X    Due to variations in personal  tastes  and  conceptions  of  how  NetHack
Xshould  do  things,  there  are  options  you  can  set to change how NetHack
Xbehaves.
X
X*** 8.1.  Setting the options
X
X    There are two ways to set the options.  The first is with the `O' command
Xin NetHack; the second is with the ``NETHACKOPTIONS'' environment variable.
X
X*** 8.2.  Using the NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable
X
X    The  NETHACKOPTIONS  variable is a comma-separated list of initial values
Xfor the various options.  Some can only be turned on or off.  You turn one of
Xthese  on  by  adding  the name of the option to the list, and turn it off by
Xtyping a `!' or ``no'' before the name.  Others take a character string as  a
Xvalue.    You  can set string options by typing the option name, a colon, and
Xthen the value of the string.  The value is terminated by the next  comma  or
Xthe end of string.
X
X    For  example, to set up an environment variable so that ``female'' is on,
X``pickup'' is off, the name is set to ``Blue Meanie'', and the fruit  is  set
Xto ``papaya'', you would enter the command:
X
X    % setenv NETHACKOPTIONS "female,!pickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"
X
X    in csh, or
X
X    $ NETHACKOPTIONS="female,!pickup,name:Blue Meanie,fruit:papaya"
X    $ export NETHACKOPTIONS
X
X    in sh or ksh.
X
X*** 8.3.  Customization options
X
X    Here  are explanations of what the various options do.  Character strings
Xlonger than fifty characters are truncated.  Some of the options  listed  may
Xbe inactive in your dungeon.
X
Xcatname
X        Name your starting cat (ex. ``catname:Morris'').  Cannot be set  with
X        the `O' command.
X
Xcolor
X        Use color for  different  monsters,  objects,  and  dungeon  features
X        (default on).
X
Xconfirm
X        Have user confirm attacks on pets, shopkeepers, and  other  peaceable
X        creatures (default on).
X
XDECgraphics
X        Use a predefined selection  of  characters  from  the  DEC  VTxxx/DEC
X        Rainbow/  ANSI  line-drawing  character  set  to  display the dungeon
X        instead of having to define a full  graphics  set  yourself  (default
X        off).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.
X
Xdogname
X        Name your starting dog (ex.  ``dogname:Fang'').  Cannot be  set  with
X        the `O' command.
X
Xendgame
X        Control what parts of the score list you are shown at the end
X        (ex. ``endgame:5  top  scores/4  around  my score/own  scores'').
X        Only the first  letter  of  each  category  (`t',  `a',  or  `o')  is
X        necessary.
X
Xfemale
X        Set your sex (default off).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.
X
Xfixinvlet
X        An  object's inventory letter sticks to it when it's dropped (default
X        on).  If this is off, dropping an object  shifts  all  the  remaining
X        inventory letters.
X
Xfruit
X        Name a fruit after something you enjoy eating (ex.   ``fruit:mango'')
X        (default  ``slime  mold''.  Basically a nostalgic whimsy that NetHack
X        uses from time to time.  You should set this to  something  you  find
X        more  appetizing  than  slime mold.  Apples, oranges, pears, bananas,
X        and melons already exist in NetHack, so don't use those.
X
Xgraphics
X        Set the graphics symbols for screen displays (default
X        ``|--------|||-\\/.-|+.#<>^"}{#\\_<>##'').  The graphics  option  (if
X        used)  should  come last, followed by a string of up to 35 characters
X        to be used instead  of  the  default  map-drawing  characters.    The
X        dungeon  map  will  use  the  characters  you  specify instead of the
X        default symbols.
X
X        The DECgraphics and IBMgraphics options use predefined selections  of
X        graphics  symbols,  so you need not go to the trouble of setting up a
X        full graphics string for these common cases.
X
X        Note that this option string is now escape-processed in  conventional
X        C  fashion.    This  means that `\' is a prefix to take the following
X        character literally, and not as a  special  prefix.    Your  graphics
X        strings for NetHack 2.2 and older versions may contain a `\'; it must
X        be doubled for the same effect now.  The  special  escape  form  `\m'
X        switches  on  the  meta  bit  in the following character, and the `^'
X        prefix causes the following character to  be  treated  as  a  control
X        character  (so any `^' in your old graphics strings should be changed
X        to `\^' now).
X
X        The order of the symbols is:  solid rock, vertical  wall,  horizontal
X        wall, upper left corner, upper right corner, lower left corner, lower
X        right corner, cross wall, upward T wall, downward T wall, leftward  T
X        wall,  rightward  T wall, vertical beam, horizontal beam, left slant,
X        right slant, no door,  vertical  open  door,  horizontal  open  door,
X        closed door, floor of a room, corridor, stairs up, stairs down, trap,
X        web, pool or moat, fountain, kitchen sink, throne, altar, ladder  up,
X        ladder  down,  vertical drawbridge, horizontal drawbridge.  You might
X        want to use `+' for the corners and T  walls  for  a  more  esthetic,
X        boxier  display.    Note that in the next release, new symbols may be
X        added, or the present ones rearranged.
X
X        Cannot be set with the `O' command.
X
Xhelp
X        If more information is available for an object looked at with the `/'
X        command, ask if you want to see it (default  on).  Turning  help  off
X        makes  just  looking  at  things faster, since you aren't interrupted
X        with the ``More info?'' prompt, but it also means that you might miss
X        some interesting and/or important information.
X
XIBM_BIOS
X        Use BIOS calls to update the screen display quickly and to  read  the
X        keyboard (allowing the use of arrow keys to move) on machines with an
X        IBM PC compatible BIOS ROM (default off, PC and ST NetHack only).
X
XIBMgraphics
X        Use  a  predefined  selection  of  IBM  extended  ASCII characters to
X        display the dungeon instead of having to define a full  graphics  set
X        yourself (default off).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.
X
Xignintr
X        Ignore interrupt signals, including breaks (default off).
X
Xmale
X        Set your sex (default on, most hackers are male).  Cannot be set with
X        the `O' command.
X
Xname
X        Set your character's name (defaults to your user name).  You can also
X        set your character class by appending a dash and the first letter  of
X        the  character  class (that is, by suffixing one of -A -B -C -E -H -K
X        -P -R -S -T -V -W).  Cannot be set with the `O' command.
X
Xnews
X        Read  the NetHack news file, if present (default on).  Since the news
X        is shown at the beginning of the game, there's no  point  in  setting
X        this with the `O' command.
X
Xnumber_pad
X        Use the number keys to move instead of [yuhjklbn] (default off).
X
Xnull
X        Send padding nulls to the terminal (default off).
X
Xpackorder
X        Specify   the   order   to   list   object    types    in    (default
X        ``\")[%?+/=!(*'0_'').    The  value of this option should be a string
X        containing the symbols for the various object types.
X
Xpickup
X        Pick up things you move onto by default (default on).
X
Xrawio
X        Force raw (non-cbreak) mode for faster output  and  more  bulletproof
X        input  (MS-DOS  sometimes treats `^P' as a printer toggle without it)
X        (default off).  Note:  DEC  Rainbows  hang  if  this  is  turned  on.
X        Cannot be set with the `O' command.
X
Xrest_on_space
X        Make the space bar a synonym for  the  `.'  (rest)  command  (default
X        off).
X
Xsafe_pet
X        Prevent you from (knowingly) attacking your pets (default on).
X
Xsilent
X        Suppress terminal beeps (default on).
X
Xsortpack
X        Sort the pack contents by type  when  displaying  inventory  (default
X        on).
X
Xstandout
X        Boldface monsters and ``--More--'' (default off).
X
Xtime
X        Show the elapsed game time in turns on bottom line (default off).
X
Xtombstone
X        Draw a tombstone graphic upon your death (default on).
X
Xverbose
X        Provide more commentary during the game (default on).
X
X    In  some  versions, options may be set in a configuration file on disk as
Xwell as from NETHACKOPTIONS.
X
X*** 9.  Scoring
X
X    NetHack maintains a list of the top scores or scorers  on  your  machine,
Xdepending  on  how  it  is  set  up.  In the latter case, each account on the
Xmachine can post only one non-winning score on  this  list.    If  you  score
Xhigher  than  someone  else  on this list, or better your previous score, you
Xwill be inserted in the proper place under  your  current  name.    How  many
Xscores are kept can also be set up when NetHack is compiled.
X
X    Your score is chiefly based upon how much experience you gained, how much
Xloot you accumulated, how deep you explored, and how the game ended.  If  you
Xquit the game, you escape with all of your gold intact.  If, however, you get
Xkilled in the Mazes of Menace, the guild will only hear  about  90%  of  your
Xgold  when  your corpse is discovered (adventurers have been known to collect
Xfinder's fees).  So, consider whether you want to take one last hit  at  that
Xmonster  and  possibly live, or quit and stop with whatever you have.  If you
Xquit, you keep all your gold, but if you swing and live, you might find more.
X
X    If you just want to see what the current top players/games list  is,  you
Xcan type nethack -s all.
X
X*** 10.  Explore mode
X
X    NetHack  is  an  intricate  and  difficult game.  Novices might falter in
Xfear, aware of their ignorance of the means to  survive.    Well,  fear  not.
XYour dungeon may come equipped with an ``explore'' or ``discovery'' mode that
Xenables you to keep old save files and cheat death, at the paltry cost of not
Xgetting on the high score list.
X
X    There  are  two  ways of enabling explore mode.  One is to start the game
Xwith the -X switch.  The other is to issue  the  `X'  command  while  already
Xplaying the game.  The other benefits of explore mode are left for the trepid
Xreader to discover.
X
X*** 11.  Credits
X
X    The original hack game was modeled  on  the  Berkeley  UNIX  rogue  game.
XLarge  portions  of  this  paper were shamelessly cribbed from A Guide to the
XDungeons of Doom, by Michael C. Toy and Kenneth  C.  R.  C.  Arnold.    Small
Xportions  were  adapted  from Further Exploration of the Dungeons of Doom, by
XKen Arromdee.
X
X    NetHack is the product of literally dozens of people's work.  Main events
Xin the course of the game development are described below:
X
X    Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack, with help from Kenny Woodland, Mike
XThome and Jon Payne.
X
X    Andries Brouwer did a major  re-write,  transforming  Hack  into  a  very
Xdifferent  game,  and  published (at least) three versions (1.0.1, 1.0.2, and
X1.0.3) for UNIX machines to the Usenet.
X
X    Don G. Kneller ported Hack 1.0.3 to Microsoft C and MS-DOS, producing  PC
XHACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g, and went
Xon to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).
X
X    R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to  Lattice  C  and  the  Atari  520/1040ST,
Xproducing ST Hack 1.03.
X
X    Mike   Stephenson   merged   these   various   versions   back  together,
Xincorporating many of the added features, and produced NetHack 1.4.  He  then
Xcoordinated  a  cast  of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and
Xreleased NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.
X
X    Later, Mike coordinated a major rewrite of the game, heading a team which
Xincluded Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson,
XIzchak Miller, John Rupley, Mike  Threepoint,  and  Janet  Walz,  to  produce
XNetHack 3.0c.
X
X    NetHack  3.0  was  ported  to the Atari by Eric R. Smith, to OS/2 by Timo
XHakulinen, and to VMS by David Gentzel.  The three of them  and  Kevin  Darcy
Xlater  joined  the  main  development team to produce subsequent revisions of
X3.0.
X
X    Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0  to  the  Amiga.    Norm  Meluch,
XStephen  Spackman  and  Pierre Martineau designed overlay code for PC NetHack
X3.0.  Johnny Lee ported NetHack 3.0 to the Macintosh.    Along  with  various
Xother  Dungeoneers,  they  continued  to enhance the PC, Macintosh, and Amiga
Xports through the later revisions of 3.0.
X
X    From time to time, some depraved individual out there in netland sends  a
Xparticularly  intriguing modification to help out with the game.  The Gods of
Xthe Dungeon sometimes make note of the names of the worst of these miscreants
