# nethack-origins
An archive of original Usenet posts for Hack and NetHack through version 3.1.3.

Sources of these files are as follows:

* For Hack and NetHack through 3.0.10, these are drawn from the UTZOO Usenet Archive,
  available at https://archive.org/details/utzoo-wiseman-usenet-archive and numerous
  other sites.

* For NetHack 3.1.0 through 3.1.3, and the nethack-2.3e-uunet directory: These are files
  saved from the UUNet FTP site while that site still operated.

These posts contain "shar" archives, which when run by a POSIX-compatible shell, generate
the archived files in the current directory. I have run these shar archives on my own
computer and have no reason to believe they contain any harmful commands; but I assume no
liability for any damages. Use these files at your own risk. Run them on a virtual machine
if you're paranoid.
